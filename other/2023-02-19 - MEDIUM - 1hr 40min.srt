1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 Please turn with me to 2 Samuel chapter 12 verses 13 to 25.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,280
 You can also follow along on page 7 of your bulletin.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,840
 Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,460
 Nathan replied, the Lord has taken away your sin.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,960
 You are not going to die.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,920
 But because by doing this, you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,160
 The son born to you will die.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:36,880
 After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife had born to David,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,960
 and he became ill.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
 David pleaded with God for the child.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
 He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,920
 The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,260
 and he would not eat any food with them.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,519
 On the seventh day, the child died.

15
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,000
 David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, while

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 the child was still living, we spoke to David, but he would not listen to us.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,720
 How can we tell him the child is dead?

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,840
 He may do something desperate.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,680
 David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,039
 was dead.

21
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,440
 Is the child dead?

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
 He asked.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,300
 Yes, they replied.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,280
 He is dead.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,800
 Then David got up from the ground.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,960
 After he had washed, put on lotions, and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
 Lord and worshiped.

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,620
 Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,080
 His servants asked him, Why are you acting this way?

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,920
 While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,979
 get up and eat.

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:59,000
 He answered, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,080
 I thought, Who knows?

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,800
 The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live, but now that he is dead, why should

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,200
 I fast?

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,280
 Can I bring him back again?

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,680
 I will go to him, but he will not return to me.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,040
 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her.

39
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,680
 She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,040
 The Lord loved him, and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet

41
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,940
 to name him Jedidiah.

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,400
 This is the word of the Lord.

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,240
 If you're new or visiting, we've been looking at passages in the Old Testament that demonstrate

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:45,040
 how God works through brokenness to bring about salvation, and how he works in that

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 to build character.

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,120
 It's kind of like a mini theme among this overarching theme that we've had about the

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
 Old Testament.

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,000
 But I've got to tell you, passages like today's are really, really difficult.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,680
 You see, David was a man after God's own heart, but in 2 Samuel 11, his life just completely

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,160
 blows up.

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,600
 It takes his friend, a good friend, Nathan, to come to him and wake him up out of his

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,240
 self-deception, out of his lies and manipulation.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,720
 He's trapped himself in his sin.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,960
 That's verse 13, but then in verse 14 he says, because of this, because you disregarded God's

55
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,120
 law and because you disregarded essentially God's heart, you broke his heart, that son

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,760
 that was born through this adultery will die.

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,280
 This is a really, really difficult passage.

58
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
 Why?

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
 One, theologically, I mean, you've got to wrap your arms around this.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,960
 Why does God do this?

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
 Why would God do such a thing?

62
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,040
 I mean, Nathan said God had forgiven him.

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
 Then why this type of suffering?

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,320
 That reaches so deep, it's almost like he's tearing his heart apart.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,079
 Secondly, I mean, it's really personal.

66
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:56,000
 My own wife and I, we've been through four miscarriages.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,200
 And anyone here, I mean, I know there are a lot of people here, if you're married, if

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,160
 you've been trying to have children, and you understand, every one of those, we lost a

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,079
 total of about seven children.

70
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,079
 All of them were hard.

71
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,120
 I mean, I'm talking on the floor, in your bed.

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,240
 I can't move difficulty.

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,360
 Each one of them painful.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,840
 When Angela was pregnant with my son, David, at that point, we had pretty much given up

75
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
 having children.

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
 And if you know anything about my history, I mean, we love children.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,140
 I ran a camp for children and for youth for decades.

78
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,120
 And so that was really my only touch point with ministry in an active way.

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,080
 And when Angela was pregnant with David, it was really hard for me personally to get really

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
 excited about it.

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,520
 Because week after week, I was like, this is going to be the week when the shoe drops.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
 And I just assumed, my wife would be like, we just passed the first trimester.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,160
 Well, we lost a kid after that one time.

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,440
 And so it was just really hard for me to engage there personally.

85
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,600
 And I struggled with that, because every week I was just kind of waiting.

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,200
 And you do this for 10 months, it shapes you, you see?

87
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,560
 And David, we named him David because he was the eighth child.

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,920
 The actual King David was the eighth child.

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,280
 And he was born through a weakness and in weakness.

90
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,320
 And we said, well, that's what we're going to name him when he was born.

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,920
 Thirdly, I know that because of this, I mean, we had a ton of people around us during this

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,200
 time.

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,820
 But I know that there are women in this room who haven't had a lot of people around them.

94
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,600
 And they are suffering silently.

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,760
 I know there are people that's in this room.

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,520
 It doesn't even have to be in this context.

97
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,640
 You're just in a lot of suffering.

98
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
 You've suffered something.

99
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,760
 It could be something, I'm talking real trauma, right?

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,599
 And you've done it silently.

101
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:50,520
 So passages like this are really, really difficult to preach.

102
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
 And yet they're in the Bible.

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,320
 You can't overlook it.

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,599
 How do you develop poise?

105
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,800
 A poise to confront the most painful moments of your life?

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,039
 How do you develop the poise to process even the most painful moments in your life without

107
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,720
 turning bitter, without despairing?

108
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,880
 I mean, for David and for us, we're going to see three things then today.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:23,600
 I mean, I can't do justice to the feelings and the suffering that actually takes place

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 in this passage.

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:33,240
 But I can pull out three lessons about suffering, what it is, how you respond to it, and how

112
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 do you actually recover?

113
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,840
 That's what we're going to look at today.

114
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,239
 First, what is suffering?

115
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:46,640
 Verse 15, it says that the Lord struck the child that your wife had born to David and

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
 he became ill.

117
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,840
 And verse 16, so David's pleading with God and he's fasting and he's praying and he's

118
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,359
 spent nights on the ground.

119
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:59,080
 Verse 17, the elders of that household, they stood beside David to get him up from the

120
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
 ground, but he refused.

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,080
 He refused to eat.

122
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,239
 He wouldn't eat any food with them.

123
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,239
 Why?

124
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,320
 Why was he on the ground?

125
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,520
 Part of the reason is because this is a posture of prayer.

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,040
 It's a posture of humility.

127
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,960
 A lot of Near Eastern and ancient cultures as well as Eastern cultures, the Lower U-Bow,

128
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,719
 for instance, demonstrates a level of respect.

129
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,280
 David is on the ground.

130
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,480
 So there's a humble posture here.

131
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,880
 There was a prayer posture, but notice the elders, they're trying to get him up.

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,680
 They were certainly not trying to get David to stop praying.

133
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
 So why?

134
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
 Why was he on the ground?

135
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 It's because he was crushed.

136
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,320
 He was just so defeated, crushed, on the ground, on the floor, writhing around, wrestling with

137
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
 God.

138
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,200
 David in a sense is saying, I'm the one who deserves to die here.

139
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,840
 I mean, if my son dies, I'm dead.

140
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
 I'm as good as dead.

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,960
 Parents, you know, when your child is sick, you've been through this a million times over

142
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,400
 10, 15 years, 20 years, and some of your children may have suffered, I mean, some big serious

143
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 illnesses.

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,080
 But you know, if you could do anything to take that illness away from that child, if

145
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,320
 you could take it on yourself, you would.

146
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,400
 This is David saying, this child, this infant child is suffering and dying, and he's saying,

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,880
 I'm the one who deserves to die.

148
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
 I should be there.

149
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,640
 Sometimes that suffering, that pain, that grief is so great, it crushes you.

150
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:28,320
 And when you lose somebody, we'd rather take their place, we say.

151
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,199
 I mean, you're love for that person.

152
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 But we can't stand.

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,920
 He can't move.

154
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
 That's where David is.

155
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,000
 Look, in Western cultures, death is like a sobering experience.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,520
 You stand around, and if you've ever been to a funeral and they're lowering the casket

157
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,680
 into the ground, there is crying, there may be some weeping.

158
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,360
 If you go to a viewing, there's some weeping, there's some crying.

159
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,800
 But we're taught in Western cultures to internalize that pain.

160
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,960
 We're taught to be strong, to hold your posture, hold your poise.

161
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,880
 In the Eastern culture, in the Near Eastern culture, in the ancient culture, you have

162
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,760
 to hold people back from jumping and throwing themselves onto a funeral pyre, and that's

163
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 David.

164
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,720
 But then, this is David.

165
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,620
 He's the chosen king.

166
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,080
 This is the man after God's own heart, and it happened to him.

167
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
 What does this passage teach you?

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 A couple things.

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,440
 One, because we're sinners, because of sin in general.

170
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
 It's just broken the world.

171
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:37,880
 If you don't die young, at some point in your life, you are going to suffer.

172
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,280
 You're going to experience on the ground, on the floor, writhing in pain, suffering.

173
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,240
 You're going to at some point in life.

174
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,600
 So let me, I mean, if it happened to David in a sense, and David was the king, he was

175
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,040
 the chosen king, he was a man after God's own heart, if it can happen to him, and God's

176
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,920
 got his eyes on David, it can happen to you.

177
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,520
 So let me speak to you like a brother.

178
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,599
 Let me speak to you like a father, one of the older people here in this room.

179
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:13,560
 Because of sin in general, because of the curse of sin, because of the brokenness that

180
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,839
 comes from sin, life is designed to crush you.

181
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,719
 Life is designed to test every foundation that you think you're standing on as solid

182
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:25,000
 ground.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,880
 That means you're going to lose people that you love.

184
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,000
 I mean, the finality of it, for good, at the least, that's what's going to happen in your

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 life.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Some of you have lost people.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,480
 I've lost a father at five.

188
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,439
 There are people who've lost their parents.

189
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,439
 You understand.

190
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,880
 I mean, you cannot expect it, even if you're expecting it, it's like a shock.

191
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,080
 It just kind of, it's not even, it punches you in the face and then kind of eases you

192
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,660
 into just a world of like chaos for I don't know how many years.

193
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,800
 So some of us are going to lose people that we love.

194
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,560
 David, I mean, this is the chosen king.

195
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,359
 He's on the ground because death doesn't care who he is.

196
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:09,199
 Life doesn't care who he is, right?

197
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:13,199
 Life is designed to crush who he is.

198
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:18,400
 But then all of a sudden, he gets up.

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,640
 He gets up.

200
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,280
 His servants are amazed and they're confused.

201
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,079
 I mean, when he was alive, you were writhing around on the floor, you were wrestling on

202
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,560
 the ground, but why do you get up?

203
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,400
 God is giving us today an amazing resource to show us on one hand, we're all sinners

204
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,199
 and we live in a broken world that has just been devastated by sin in general and so because

205
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,560
 of sin, we're all sufferers.

206
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,680
 We're all sufferers, but on the other hand, it's actually possible.

207
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,800
 There's a resource here in this text that shows us it's possible to get up.

208
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 How?

209
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 Well, it depends on what you do.

210
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,280
 It depends on what you're doing when you're down there on the ground, on the floor.

211
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
 So how do you respond?

212
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 That's the second point.

213
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 How do you respond in suffering?

214
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,000
 There are three things that David grasped when he was on the ground and because he grasped

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 these things, he was able to get up.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,800
 He was actually able to find strength again and recover.

217
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:18,959
 First, he learned, this is really important, he learned that his suffering is not a punishment.

218
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,720
 It's not a reaction for his sins.

219
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,520
 There are times when we suffer as a direct result of our sins.

220
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,200
 Don't get me wrong.

221
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,680
 There are times when there are things that happen because essentially it's not like you

222
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,320
 asked for it, not that kind of stuff.

223
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
 I'm saying that there are things that happen as a direct result.

224
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
 For instance, you steal, you get caught, you go to jail.

225
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,140
 That's a direct reaction.

226
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,040
 That's not the kind of suffering we're talking about here.

227
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,640
 David here learned that his suffering is not a punishment for his sins.

228
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,719
 Remember, David had an affair with Uriah's wife.

229
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,920
 That's one of his best friends.

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,400
 And he gets her pregnant and in order to come out clean, what does he do?

231
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,240
 He arranges to have that friend of his murdered in battle, killed in battle along with other

232
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,079
 people.

233
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,240
 And it looked like he got away with it.

234
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,400
 But God saw all of it.

235
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,280
 And he sends Nathan, Nathan's a prophet, to confront David and David repents.

236
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,079
 Last week, if you were here last week, we looked at David's prayer, his psalm of repentance

237
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,160
 after this particular narrative.

238
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,600
 And verse 13, which we read today, it pretty much sums up that psalm, Psalm 51.

239
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,959
 I've sinned against the Lord.

240
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,319
 Meanwhile, Bathsheba, she's pregnant.

241
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,800
 He takes her in as his wife.

242
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,719
 She has a child, that's David's child.

243
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:47,479
 It was this infant that was struck by God.

244
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,479
 That's what the text says.

245
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:55,680
 Now, when you read this cursory, when you read this superficially, you may conclude,

246
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,040
 well, this is God seeking justice for what he's done.

247
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,680
 This is God seeking punishment, justice for David.

248
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,000
 And we say, well, there it is.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I knew it.

250
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,359
 Metro is no different from any other church.

251
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,240
 That fire and brimstone God of the Bible who's always angry, always cruel, it's why I can't

252
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,520
 believe in a God like this.

253
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,200
 Look, you need to read this passage more carefully.

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 And that's why we're here.

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,000
 In verse 13, God says through Nathan, the Lord has taken away your sin.

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,240
 You are not going to die.

257
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,360
 But now you need to think about that, meditate on that a little bit.

258
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,240
 In the Old Testament, when he says, whenever you hear the phrase, the Lord has taken away

259
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,620
 your sin, that that meaning is very, very clear.

260
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,440
 That means forensically, legally, you are no longer responsible.

261
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,280
 You are no longer held liable.

262
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,440
 There is no justice nor retribution that will be taken out on you for what you have done.

263
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,680
 The Lord has literally taken that guilt, taken that sin, and has taken it away so it is no

264
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,920
 longer making you liable.

265
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
 Right?

266
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,800
 Nathan says, you are not going to die.

267
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 God has forgiven you.

268
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,200
 You are not going to die because if he dies, that would have been justice.

269
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,800
 It was a capital crime, multiple capital crimes that David had committed in that moment.

270
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,280
 When he had your eye killed, when he got Bathsheba pregnant.

271
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,920
 Nathan says first, you're not going to be punished.

272
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,880
 The Lord is not holding you liable.

273
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
 You are not going to die.

274
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 But it's also very clear.

275
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
 This is the second thing.

276
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,600
 When Nathan says in verse 13, you are not going to die, then he says in verse 14, but.

277
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 He says you're forgiven.

278
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,920
 You're not going to die, but your son will die.

279
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
 What does that mean?

280
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,640
 It means there must be another reason for a son's death.

281
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,760
 But at the least, it's not justice.

282
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
 It's not punishment.

283
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,560
 Well, if it's not, then why does he make him suffer so much?

284
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,760
 You see, if David believed that his current suffering was a punishment for what he did,

285
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,240
 he would never have been able to get off the ground.

286
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,719
 He would have thrown himself off a cliff.

287
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,719
 You see that?

288
00:15:56,719 --> 00:16:01,199
 That guilt would have been overbearing, overwhelming, and he would never have been able to get off

289
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 the ground.

290
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,600
 The reason why, if you look at the Old Testament, the entire book of Job, which is a book in

291
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,760
 the Old Testament, very famous passage, very famous book, it's written to refute Job's

292
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,760
 friends.

293
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,280
 The whole book was written around the counsel of Job's friends.

294
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:25,680
 Job was a godly man, but God allows for tremendous suffering to happen to Job.

295
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,800
 He allows it.

296
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,420
 And Job's friends, their view is a common view, a very worldly view, even though they

297
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,560
 come as people of God.

298
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,199
 They basically say their view is this, if you live right, then God's gonna bless you.

299
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,560
 If you live a good life, then God is gonna give you a good life.

300
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,359
 And so if you have a bad life, then you must have done something wrong.

301
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:50,819
 You must be in sin, and God is demonstrating his retribution or his justice.

302
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,839
 This is punishment for you.

303
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,880
 But what happens if you try to live right, and you're just crushed like Job?

304
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,600
 Either A, you're gonna say, well, I deserve it.

305
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,120
 There's gonna be a lot of, you're gonna hate yourself, there's gonna be a lot of self-pity.

306
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,880
 Or B, you're gonna say, I don't deserve this.

307
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
 I've been trying to live right.

308
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,540
 And you're gonna hate God, or you're gonna hate somebody else, you're gonna blame somebody

309
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
 else for it.

310
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,300
 Life is always going to be confusing when you come with that worldview, if you hold

311
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,020
 to that view, because either you're gonna hate yourself, or you're gonna hate God.

312
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,040
 Because you're never gonna be able to avoid the suffering, it's gonna happen.

313
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,680
 You see that?

314
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,200
 Some of us, I mean, we've been there.

315
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,400
 As a pastor, after what, 11 years now here at Metro, I think suffering is probably one

316
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,680
 of the single greatest reasons for why people abandon God.

317
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,480
 Forget about abandoning church.

318
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,600
 It's one of the greatest reasons why people just kind of sift away from God.

319
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,400
 And most people, we do a little bit of both.

320
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,480
 We hate ourselves a little bit, and we hate God.

321
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
 And it's subtle.

322
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
 It's like very, very subtle.

323
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,120
 We do, we kind of inch away from Him.

324
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,560
 We're not gonna just kind of drastically walk away, but we inch away from Him relationally

325
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,040
 before we inch away from Him geographically.

326
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,920
 Before we stop going to the church, we distance ourselves in a lot of different ways.

327
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,960
 We're very, very, if you really think about it, that's what we do.

328
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,880
 So we live very powerless lives, because we ultimately never got off the ground.

329
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,080
 We're still metaphorically still on the ground.

330
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,320
 I'm gonna give you a phrase we're gonna say a lot, by faith.

331
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,480
 Only by faith can you believe what Nathan said to David.

332
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,800
 When you're enduring, I mean, some of us right now, we're in it.

333
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,560
 And I know.

334
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
 It's hard to see.

335
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,400
 When you're in that, it's dark, and it's just really, forget about the stress and the pressure.

336
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,640
 It's like you're swimming in a sea of just chaos and darkness.

337
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,720
 And you just kind of let yourself go a little bit, right?

338
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,800
 We're in it.

339
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,160
 And only by faith then can you believe what Nathan actually said to David, that you're

340
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,760
 not being punished right now for what you did.

341
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,800
 Well, then why do you go through this?

342
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,560
 Well, the second thing that David learned when he was on the ground is that suffering

343
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,760
 is surgery, a heart surgery.

344
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,480
 God isn't trying to hurt David.

345
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 God isn't trying to break David.

346
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,600
 Well, I mean, he took away his child, right?

347
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,120
 I mean, how can you say that?

348
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,560
 The difference between a serial killer and a doctor or a surgeon is what?

349
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,800
 They're both holding knives.

350
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,520
 They're both somewhat skilled.

351
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,400
 Is that one is trying to hurt you and kill you, the other is trying to save you.

352
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,200
 God is trying to heal David through this brokenness.

353
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,680
 It's hard for us to kind of grasp that and the why of that.

354
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,080
 Nathan says in verse 14, because by doing this, this adultery, this murder, literally

355
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,520
 in Hebrew what he says is, and we read this in the text, because you have shown contempt

356
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,680
 for the Lord, this son will die.

357
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,480
 You see the word contempt, it means to take something lightly, to completely dismiss something.

358
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,200
 It's actually the opposite of giving glory to something.

359
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,320
 The word glory is kabod.

360
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
 Contempt is the opposite word in a sense.

361
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,160
 When you show glory, when you demonstrate glory, when you take glory of something, you

362
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,680
 are sensing the reality of something.

363
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,240
 You're sensing God's reality.

364
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,440
 You're sensing the weight of his beauty, the weight of his brilliance.

365
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
 It's heavy.

366
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,000
 It's weighty in your life, and it's so weighty, it actually shapes you, kind of contorts you.

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,780
 It shapes the way you live.

368
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,800
 To treat God then less real, to dismiss that heavy presence, that weightiness of his beauty

369
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,320
 and his holiness in his life is to show then utter contempt.

370
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,200
 Now, it doesn't mean it's because you didn't know.

371
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,840
 Maybe you knew a lot about God.

372
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,280
 Maybe you know a lot about God.

373
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,639
 Maybe you've learned a lot.

374
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:56,360
 Maybe you went to school teaching you about God, but that knowledge hasn't changed you.

375
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,800
 It hasn't shaped you the way you live your current reality.

376
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,159
 Maybe you even feel a little bit.

377
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,280
 You're moved once in a while, but it's not weighty enough to change the way you live

378
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,560
 in those patterns that you live in your life.

379
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
 You see that?

380
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
 It hasn't shaped you in that way.

381
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,480
 Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors.

382
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,840
 He's a New York Times bestselling author.

383
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
 He wrote a book called Blink.

384
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,159
 It was, I think, his second big book that he's written.

385
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:21,879
 I'm just going to paraphrase one part.

386
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:26,240
 He refers to this marriage counselor in the book who, after observing a couple, and that's

387
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,000
 what he does for a living, he just counsels marriages.

388
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,760
 But after having so many counseling experiences and examples in his life, he can just watch

389
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,060
 a couple in silence.

390
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,520
 Their voices are muted.

391
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,760
 He's got these brainwave things that are on them, and it's kind of scrolling through.

392
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,520
 He used to monitor them, but he says, I can just watch them.

393
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,160
 After three minutes, or it's like two or three minutes or something like that, he can predict

394
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
 whether or not this marriage is going to make it.

395
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,720
 What does he see?

396
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,960
 What is he looking for?

397
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,920
 He says one of the things that he's looking for is whether or not the husband and the

398
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,000
 wife are in an argument, and they demonstrate contempt for each other.

399
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,120
 He says that's the death note.

400
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,240
 When I see that, it's over.

401
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,400
 Almost every couple that shows contempt, almost every marriage where there's contempt in the

402
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
 marriage, it ends in failure.

403
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,800
 Nathan here, he says to David, you have shown contempt for God.

404
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,680
 You are relationally bound together by a covenant.

405
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,080
 This love-binding promise, this life-binding promise, and you dismissed it.

406
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,200
 You've not seen the weightiness of it.

407
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,600
 You've kind of walked away from it.

408
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,879
 You abandoned his love, you abandoned his honor, you abandoned his love for you, his

409
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:40,840
 delight in you, his embrace for you, and so you've distanced yourself, you've divorced

410
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,159
 yourself from God.

411
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,320
 What kind of man would take another man's wife and then take his life?

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,480
 Either you don't believe in God, or God's beauty and his brilliance and his love and

413
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,159
 his law, they're just concepts that never really entered into your soul and shaped your

414
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,159
 life.

415
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,120
 You've dismissed God, you've shown contempt for God.

416
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,560
 Instead, you've been captivated by power and your lusts and your wealth and your skills

417
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,040
 and your wiles and your maneuvering.

418
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:18,160
 I mean, you could have seen Bathsheba taking that bath from a distance and walked away

419
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
 from it.

420
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,320
 But why can't any of us walk away from the things that we want?

421
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,160
 Why can't you walk away from the things that you want?

422
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,320
 Because we're all slaves to our desires.

423
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,040
 That's what the Bible says.

424
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,840
 Abraham, in the Old Testament, first book of the Bible, Abraham in Genesis, he waited

425
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,240
 for decades for a child, he finally gets that child, it's Isaac.

426
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
 Through him, God's gonna redeem the world, but then God says, I want you to surrender

427
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,360
 that son, I want you to offer that son as a sacrifice.

428
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,679
 It just ripped him apart, it tore him apart.

429
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,280
 We talked about this passage in our series.

430
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,840
 It just completely tore him apart, but he obeyed.

431
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
 Why?

432
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,600
 Because of God's brilliance, his wisdom, that calling of God, it was heavy in his life.

433
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,679
 He didn't have to be goaded into it, he had to be coerced into it or cajoled into it.

434
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,679
 Because if he was, it's because he was a slave.

435
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,399
 But he wasn't, he obeyed.

436
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:11,399
 Why?

437
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:17,600
 Because that heavy brilliance of God was so weighty for him, he didn't become a slave.

438
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,159
 Parents, do you know, parents, do you know that every modern scholar and counselor will

439
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,720
 tell you that when you make your children the center of your life, then your work will

440
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,440
 revolve around that child, your church will revolve, your experience of church and your

441
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,360
 church life will revolve around that child.

442
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,880
 Everything that you do actually revolves around your children.

443
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:46,660
 And it pleases you at first to please them, but you must know, because the weight of your

444
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:54,960
 own meaning and your own glory and your own joy has taken over the glory of God, you will

445
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,160
 press that weight then onto your children.

446
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,800
 It's gonna suffocate them under that weight because you were not as gracious as God.

447
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,880
 You were not as wise as God.

448
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,840
 And so you will suffocate them and crush them under the weight of your own expectations

449
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,000
 and you will ruin your children and because you are a slave, they'll become slaves.

450
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Because you are weak, they will become weak.

451
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,699
 You see that?

452
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:24,480
 Because you're a slave, you're gonna make them a slave to all sorts of things.

453
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
 It all begins with what?

454
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
 A contempt and a dismissal of God.

455
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,679
 God doesn't just get pushed to the periphery, he just gets completely dismissed.

456
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:33,679
 You see that?

457
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,439
 Nathan says to David, you are forgiven, but you need to be healed.

458
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,120
 You've gone so far.

459
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,719
 You have shown utter contempt for God.

460
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:50,959
 You've pushed him completely away and your life is spiraling down, which is why you've

461
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,100
 committed murder.

462
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,239
 You need to see that with your own eyes and experience that to understand how far you've

463
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,239
 gone.

464
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:08,060
 And so this pain, the suffering.

465
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,679
 Because you are a chosen king, yes on one hand you are forgiven, I love you, I've never

466
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,200
 left you, but look at you.

467
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,040
 Your loneliness and your brokenness and that lack of kingliness, that character that's

468
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,240
 missing in your life, the cowardice and the deceit and the manipulation and the self-righteousness

469
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,200
 that's all wrapped in that.

470
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,919
 You need to be healed because otherwise your life will continue to roll back, more people

471
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,280
 will die, more people will suffer around you and even though you may not die, if this kingdom

472
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,760
 and this world is going to be redeemed through you, then you need to experience, you need

473
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,879
 to come back.

474
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:53,560
 You're getting almost a visual inner perspective of the pain and the picture of how dead you

475
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,920
 are in your sin because death is separation and it's painful.

476
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,399
 Death is final and it's painful.

477
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,500
 It's over.

478
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,000
 So David, he falls to the ground and he's pleading and he's praying, you've ever been

479
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 there?

480
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,360
 I mean there are people in this room and they're saying, man I've tried that already.

481
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,520
 Pastor, I've tried that.

482
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,920
 I've pleaded and I've prayed.

483
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
 I've pleaded with God.

484
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
 I've wrestled with God.

485
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
 Nothing happened.

486
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,000
 God will not help me.

487
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,760
 I can't trust God and that's even if he exists, it's like he doesn't exist.

488
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,040
 Friends, that's what God is trying to heal David from.

489
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:34,320
 David, God stopped being a reality in his life and he had to uproot the sin that is

490
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,520
 so deep and has rooted itself in him.

491
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,560
 That's what he was trying to heal him from.

492
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,879
 The reason why we say, well I can't trust a God that allows this kind of stuff, it's

493
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,040
 the same reason why David abandoned God in the first place.

494
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,000
 Distrust, contempt, the moment you say that you're saying I'm showing contempt.

495
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,040
 I'm dismissing this.

496
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,320
 We need to be healed of that.

497
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,120
 God must have told David at some point, you see it in this passage.

498
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,399
 I need to take your son.

499
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:09,439
 He's not going to suffer anymore.

500
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,800
 He's going to be with me.

501
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,560
 I'm taking him into eternity with me but it's going to feel like death for you.

502
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,199
 It's going to feel like your heart is being ripped apart so I can give you a new heart.

503
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,199
 You're going to heal.

504
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,919
 You're going to be free again.

505
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,919
 Did it work?

506
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,280
 Yes, it worked.

507
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,239
 Verse 18, the child dies.

508
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,280
 Verse 19, David realizes that and he asks, is he dead?

509
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,800
 They say yes, it happened.

510
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 What happens?

511
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,560
 Verse 20, he gets up.

512
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,400
 Scholars say up until this point David was using everyone.

513
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,960
 Bathsheba was just an object.

514
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,080
 Uriah was just a barrier.

515
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,200
 Joab was a tool.

516
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,400
 David wasn't a servant anymore.

517
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
 He was a consumer.

518
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,800
 A lot of us here, we're just consuming and anytime we don't get what we want, whether

519
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,560
 it's in the church or at work or at home, complain, complain, complain.

520
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,760
 You're falling into that right now.

521
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,360
 A lot of us are like that towards God.

522
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,100
 We're like that towards the church but David, for David here his life changes.

523
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,480
 When he gets up, his servants are confused.

524
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,639
 Verse 21, when a child was alive you fasted and you wept but now he's dead and you get

525
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,879
 up and you're ready to eat.

526
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:27,200
 Verse 22, David says, well, when a child was alive I thought maybe the Lord will let him

527
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
 live.

528
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,480
 Maybe I suffered enough and I'm good now.

529
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
 We do that, don't we?

530
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 I'm good.

531
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
 I get it now.

532
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
 I got it guys.

533
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,320
 A lot of you, you've been through a lot and you're like, I'm good now.

534
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,320
 I get it now.

535
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,520
 I've learned a lot now.

536
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,000
 We still want to tell and dictate to God on our terms when something should start, when

537
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,960
 something should end because we think we're still wiser.

538
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,880
 Parents, you see your children, right?

539
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,880
 What's that little thing?

540
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 That's an electrical socket.

541
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,880
 Don't put your fingers there.

542
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 What do they do?

543
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,040
 They say, no, no, no, I need to do this.

544
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
 That's what they say.

545
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
 They don't say, I want to do it.

546
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,240
 Well, why dad?

547
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,840
 They say, no, no, no, it's wise for me to do this.

548
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,160
 They're like, I must do this.

549
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,540
 Right?

550
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,480
 And it's like suffering for them when you try to tell them when you block it, when you

551
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,080
 put those little things in there to prevent them from putting anything in the socket.

552
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,840
 It's like the world has ended.

553
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,920
 That's us.

554
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,600
 That's us.

555
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,480
 Robert Alter, well, David says, verse 23, now that he's dead, can I bring him back again?

556
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,719
 Robert Alter, he's a famous biblical scholar, liberal scholar.

557
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:36,919
 I think I've said this multiple times, but nobody like Robert Alter when it comes to

558
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,840
 the understanding of the ancient Hebrew.

559
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,320
 So even all conservatives, we all read him.

560
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,159
 He says that this is the first time in a long time where David is just helpless.

561
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,959
 He's just broken and helpless.

562
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:50,760
 Before he was addicted to power.

563
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,280
 Now he's just completely vulnerable.

564
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,399
 He's on the ground.

565
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,440
 And this sets the pace for the rest of his life.

566
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,920
 He's been torn down, but he's been freed.

567
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,720
 His life has changed.

568
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,680
 Before he was addicted to power, he was addicted to just his desires.

569
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
 Now he's just humble.

570
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,360
 I'm going to say it like this.

571
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:15,240
 One day, everyone is going to experience something so painful, it's going to throw you to the

572
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,760
 ground.

573
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:26,600
 And there you're going to see the link between your suffering and God's wisdom and your character.

574
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:33,320
 And if all those three things come together, there will be joy in your life.

575
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,960
 That joy will sustain.

576
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:44,040
 Suffering is the crucible by which God builds wisdom and character and kingliness unto greatness.

577
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,800
 God says, it pains me to do this.

578
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,280
 You're going to understand.

579
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
 This is God.

580
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,840
 It pains me to do this.

581
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,040
 But this is surgery.

582
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,360
 Because you have something that is life threatening.

583
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,800
 And most of the time, we are not going to know.

584
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,160
 We're going to have no idea what God is trying to free us from.

585
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,920
 It's not until months go by, maybe years go by, maybe decades, when you look back and

586
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,800
 say, okay, now I see.

587
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,040
 He was tearing away the thing that I wanted most apart from him.

588
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,080
 People weren't trying to tell me maybe.

589
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,919
 People were trying to, you know, and I just dismissed it.

590
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,360
 That's made me anxious.

591
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,800
 This thing has made me anxious.

592
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,199
 It's made me depressed.

593
00:32:25,199 --> 00:32:33,320
 It's made me lonely and proud and sinful and dismissive, murderous, hate, right?

594
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,960
 Adulterous, lustful, greedy.

595
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:47,480
 He's breaking the things that were breaking me.

596
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,240
 Because I was the way I was.

597
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
 I was breaking things.

598
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
 I was breaking relationships.

599
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,560
 But he was breaking the things that were breaking me.

600
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,680
 So you read this call to worship at the start of worship, Psalm 39, an amazing prayer because

601
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,680
 at the end, basically the psalmist says, you know, get away from me so I can have some

602
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,720
 peace in my life.

603
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,840
 Just get away from me so I can have some peace before I die.

604
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 And then the psalm ends.

605
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,040
 There's no peace.

606
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,879
 There's no praise at the end.

607
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,919
 That's why this psalm is so good.

608
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:14,600
 It's why God put it in the Bible.

609
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
 You know why?

610
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,879
 Because it tells us that God knows us.

611
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:23,919
 He hears us when we are just raw and unfiltered and just desperate and on the ground and writing

612
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,040
 all sorts of lies are coming into our hearts and we're kind of tempted to believe it and

613
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,159
 we're just kind of talking to ourselves in our hearts and we're just desperate and raw

614
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:35,159
 and in pain and on the ground.

615
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,680
 I mean, of course, it's not all good stuff, but to know that God hears us, to know that

616
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,000
 he understands, I mean, why else would it be in the Bible?

617
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And look at David.

618
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,680
 Even though David is in this terrible place spiritually, he doesn't fake it anymore.

619
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,320
 He's just on the ground.

620
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,480
 His servants are like, oh my gosh, he's going to do something desperate.

621
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,200
 He's a mess, functionally, physically, but directionally.

622
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,600
 He gets it.

623
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,279
 He now knows and never stops from there.

624
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:13,319
 It's that really proud person that says, well, because I can't see a reason for my suffering,

625
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:15,080
 there must be no reason.

626
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
 It must not be true.

627
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,400
 There must not be a good reason.

628
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
 Terrible.

629
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,000
 That's terrible logic because if you have a God that is powerful enough to stop the suffering

630
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,679
 and you may not see any redeeming part of that situation right now, then you need to

631
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,560
 trust that God, if he is infinitely powerful, he's infinitely wise enough to have reasons

632
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,320
 for why he doesn't answer your prayers because he is a God of love.

633
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,600
 Do you trust that?

634
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,080
 Do you trust that?

635
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,199
 What does David do on the floor?

636
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,880
 He knew that it wasn't punishment.

637
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,440
 He knew that it was surgery in his heart to become a wiser person, a fuller person, a

638
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,520
 deeper person, even a more joyful person.

639
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,080
 I mean, you see it in Psalm 51.

640
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,040
 You see that latter half of Psalm 51, seven or eight verses.

641
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,000
 He says, I'm going to be a worshiper again.

642
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,160
 I'm going to be joyful again.

643
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
 He knows.

644
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,120
 But only if one, you're on the floor and you're crying out to God, two, it's just really real.

645
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
 It's really personal.

646
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:10,200
 And three, you're still clinging to God no matter the outcome because the primary outcome

647
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,120
 is you are back in the Lord again.

648
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,960
 You are intimate with God again.

649
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,120
 So you pray and you pray that you have a wisdom that God has, but you may not know the answer

650
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,600
 to what God is doing or why he's doing it.

651
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,480
 You're just trusting.

652
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,560
 You're just submissive.

653
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,520
 This part's really important, verses 17 to 19.

654
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,360
 His friends, they're trying to help him, but that help, it's not even effective until verse

655
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:40,080
 20 when that recovery, that surgery is complete, when that recovery finally begins.

656
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,880
 Religious people, we tend to be really stoic in suffering.

657
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,840
 You don't want to show that you have need.

658
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,480
 You don't want to show that you are weak.

659
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,799
 Irreligious people, they don't have problems showing that they're weak, but they mourn

660
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,920
 without hope, right?

661
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,520
 They don't believe that there's any help.

662
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,759
 What's the point of trying to put up pretenses?

663
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,120
 There is no hope.

664
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:07,120
 The gospel teaches us that God knows, he understands, he wants to hear you.

665
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,280
 He wants to see that rawness.

666
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:18,520
 So you can mourn, and you gotta be real, but you can mourn with hopefulness because you

667
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,240
 can trust that God is gonna work through this.

668
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,280
 I don't know the outcome.

669
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,800
 I don't even know why.

670
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,400
 I may not know why, but I do know that God works through it.

671
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,960
 For David, his son dies, but he's renewed.

672
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
 He recovers.

673
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
 He gets up.

674
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
 How did he recover?

675
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
 That's our last point.

676
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,920
 I know this is a little bit long, but I have to, I told myself, I was wrestling myself,

677
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,360
 do I just cut it short?

678
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,160
 But we gotta do this.

679
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,000
 Some of us, we're still on the floor, how do you get up?

680
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,920
 When he gets up, he tells a little secret.

681
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:04,080
 I mean, how are you able to trust God in a way that propels you to joy?

682
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,880
 David must have heard two assurances, and we need to hear those two assurances too.

683
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,040
 What are they?

684
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,160
 Two phrases, verse 22, he will not come to me, but I will go to him.

685
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,240
 And then in verse 25, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.

686
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,720
 David named him Solomon, God sends Nathan and says, name him Jedidiah.

687
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,200
 We need to do the same in both cases.

688
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
 What do I mean by that?

689
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,859
 First, he will not come to me, I will go to him.

690
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,759
 Why is he able to say that?

691
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:40,799
 Nathan assures David, you are pardoned.

692
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:41,799
 That was the start.

693
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:46,640
 He trusted God's love, and so Psalm 51, that beautiful psalm of repentance, he begins with

694
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,259
 appealing to the unfailing love of God.

695
00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:51,419
 He trusted in God's love.

696
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:52,419
 He trusted his wisdom.

697
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,920
 He's saying one day, even this pain is going to get swallowed up by a greater joy that's

698
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
 going to come.

699
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,960
 I mean, right now, it sounds horrible, it feels awful, but unlike any other religion,

700
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,440
 the God of the Bible doesn't ask us to do anything that he hasn't done himself.

701
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,200
 The God of the Bible says to Abraham, he says to David, redemption is not going to go forward

702
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,120
 unless your son dies.

703
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,480
 Your son must die.

704
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
 Offer him up.

705
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,720
 Abraham offers his son, but then his son is spared.

706
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
 God says, and Abraham trusted him.

707
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,200
 It was brutal.

708
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,360
 Three days of just brutal journey up a mountain to sacrifice his son, but he's spared.

709
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,480
 God says to David, your son must die, and he does.

710
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,000
 So he's separated from his father.

711
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,040
 Look at the agony of David.

712
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,880
 But David never even got to know his son.

713
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,040
 And God essentially says, he's with me.

714
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 Right?

715
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,400
 Verse 22, what he's really saying is David's going to go to see him.

716
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,120
 He must have been assured that he will see him again.

717
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,760
 But when Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, there was not

718
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,200
 just a partial, temporary separation from the father.

719
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,160
 David temporarily separated from his son.

720
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,920
 Jesus Christ was completely separated from the father.

721
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,480
 He was completely separated.

722
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,520
 And remember, Jesus is in the father.

723
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
 The father is in Jesus.

724
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
 There was complete union.

725
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,600
 So when he died, this ultimate agony, this forensic separation that took place, my God,

726
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
 my God, why have you forsaken me?

727
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,640
 This is the ultimate agony.

728
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,620
 This is the ultimate desperation of the soul.

729
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,759
 So much that Jesus on the cross says, what?

730
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:37,759
 I'm thirsting.

731
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:40,440
 You think he was thirsting just for water?

732
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,680
 He was craving the one thing that was sustaining his life and his soul up until this point.

733
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,080
 Before he goes to the cross, I guess, what does he say?

734
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,440
 My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

735
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,720
 In other words, Jesus Christ was on the ground.

736
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,839
 He was wrestling on the ground, stayed on the ground.

737
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:08,000
 I mean, death, that's what he was doing.

738
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,279
 He was wrestling.

739
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:13,919
 He was beaten up.

740
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,800
 And he's wrestling with God and he's praying, take this wrath away from me.

741
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,640
 But then he says, but not my will, yours be done.

742
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
 He obeyed.

743
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,280
 He was submissive.

744
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,380
 He trusted.

745
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:33,320
 Even as God legally had separated from him, he trusted God.

746
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,040
 To the point of death, there was no contempt.

747
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,180
 The weight of the heavy brilliance of God was still there.

748
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,560
 Even as God had forensically abandoned his son and rejected him on the cross.

749
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,759
 Because when Jesus fell, he fell to his death and he fell to the utter depths and he was

750
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:54,799
 so far on the ground that they buried him and he stayed there.

751
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,480
 Death is finality.

752
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
 Death is separation.

753
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,040
 Jesus says it is finished.

754
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,360
 The debt is paid.

755
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,360
 It's over.

756
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,680
 When he got up, he rose to glory.

757
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,680
 Jesus Christ, and this is the son, there was, he experienced endless separation.

758
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,120
 The agony of separation on the cross.

759
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
 But think about this.

760
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
 Look at David.

761
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,120
 He's suffering.

762
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,520
 How much more would God, David is the father looking at his son being separated from him.

763
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:29,000
 How much more would God the father suffer watching his son?

764
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,480
 You would say we would take his place and yet he turned his face from him.

765
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,080
 God himself suffering complete separation and agony too.

766
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,799
 Others would poetically say that the Trinity was torn apart.

767
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:50,200
 It wasn't really, it was forensically, but it was torn apart.

768
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,759
 Does God hear us in our pain?

769
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:56,040
 Does God understand our suffering?

770
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,080
 Only the God of the Bible understands.

771
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:06,040
 He not only understands what it's like to suffer, but he suffered.

772
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,000
 No one ever lost a child like God lost his own son.

773
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,560
 And to the degree that you see, to the degree that you believe that God sent his own son

774
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,680
 to die for you, that God himself placed his own life to suffer for you.

775
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,720
 That's the assurance that God is in your suffering and that through your suffering, through your

776
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,920
 brokenness, when Jesus suffered and died, people said nothing good can come from this.

777
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,240
 Maybe that's what you're saying in your life, but that's what God does.

778
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,000
 He works through suffering.

779
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,400
 He works through brokenness.

780
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,900
 He works through your sin.

781
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,200
 He works through the ugliest to bring about a greater beauty, a greater joy, a greater

782
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
 victory.

783
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,480
 And if you believe that he did that through Jesus and through somebody like David, he

784
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,000
 can do that for you.

785
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 What's the assurance?

786
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,280
 Jesus received all the punishment.

787
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,640
 That's why David was forgiven.

788
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,120
 That's why we can be forgiven here.

789
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,560
 That's why we can be reconciled to God and intimate with God because Jesus Christ received

790
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,680
 all the punishment that we deserve so that we can have the reconciliation and intimacy

791
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,440
 and love and embrace that Jesus deserved.

792
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,640
 So we receive the blessing and the love and the pardon for sin.

793
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,419
 Otherwise God is not just.

794
00:43:19,419 --> 00:43:21,680
 Sin would win if he would just let us go.

795
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,480
 Even if he lets one of your smallest sins go, sin wins.

796
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,040
 You see that?

797
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,080
 So either God is love and God is just so much that he's willing to sacrifice his own son.

798
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,799
 Just the son that he loved for you or God is not loving and he's not just and Jesus

799
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:41,960
 Christ is willing and Jesus Christ basically died for no reason.

800
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
 You see that?

801
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,200
 And yet he was willing to suffer.

802
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,680
 Look at Jesus.

803
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
 He was willing to suffer.

804
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,960
 He was willing to die.

805
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,040
 He was glad for the joy set before him.

806
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,520
 That was a prayer for the city today.

807
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,040
 For the joy set before him.

808
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,319
 He was glad to die for you.

809
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,319
 Do you believe this?

810
00:43:57,319 --> 00:43:59,400
 I mean more than it just moving you.

811
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,440
 Do you get it?

812
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,760
 Because if you do then God becomes a source of your joy.

813
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,720
 You will unhook from something else as a source of your joy.

814
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,280
 God becomes a source of your joy and when suffering comes it drives you into a deeper

815
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,240
 joy the way roots extend deeper into the depths during drought or in fire or in the desert

816
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:25,520
 to find an everlasting well of a loving and just God who saves into eternity.

817
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,920
 It makes us more like Jesus.

818
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,520
 Shapes our character.

819
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,800
 The reality is that look we're all sinners.

820
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,040
 We're all sufferers.

821
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,240
 But can you suffer with poise?

822
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,200
 Jesus didn't suffer to take away all of our suffering or any suffering in our lives but

823
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,600
 so that when we suffer it's not a punishment.

824
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,840
 It's not to ruin you but it will grow you, shape you, change you into a greater intimacy

825
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,940
 with God that only Jesus enjoyed himself.

826
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,560
 That's going to make you more like Jesus.

827
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
 That's going to shape you.

828
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,880
 That weightiness of his beauty and brilliance will shape you to make you more like his child.

829
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,760
 And so if you look at Jesus, the ultimate suffering on the cross, why did he stay there?

830
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,560
 Because he says if you die then it's like I'm dead.

831
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:26,400
 Actually he said so that you wouldn't die, I'll die.

832
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,840
 Because what's going to get you off the ground?

833
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,040
 Well there's one more thing.

834
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,080
 We said there were three things that he learned.

835
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,200
 One more thing that gets him up and allows him to recover.

836
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:43,880
 Verse 24 he says, then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and they slept together and

837
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,440
 Bathsheba gave birth to a son, Danian and Solomon.

838
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,020
 The Lord loved him and because the Lord loved him he sent word through Nathan the prophet

839
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:56,280
 to name him Jedediah which means, Jedediah means the beloved of God.

840
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,840
 He delighted in Jedediah.

841
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
 This is amazing.

842
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
 David had several wives.

843
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,280
 You have to understand this.

844
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,480
 He had several children.

845
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:10,240
 But God gives David and Bathsheba this kind of prostitute-ish person, disgraced woman.

846
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,960
 He gives them both another child, another son.

847
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,840
 You need to know that Solomon, the word Solomon comes, is derived from the word shalom.

848
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
 Right?

849
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,600
 Kind of sounds the same, right?

850
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,120
 It's a holistic peace.

851
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,120
 David is saying in the name of Solomon, because it's my way of saying to God, I'm at peace.

852
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
 I'm at peace.

853
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,120
 But God says no.

854
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,359
 I want you to name him Jedediah.

855
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,440
 The Lord loves.

856
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,920
 The Lord delights in this child.

857
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,240
 Of all the marriages, this is the marriage he chose.

858
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,440
 Of all the children, this is the one, the one that suffered, the one that was ugly and

859
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,560
 disgraced to save the world.

860
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,000
 That means, you know what that means?

861
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 David screwed up.

862
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,440
 Yes, he was an adulterer.

863
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,440
 He was a murderer.

864
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,480
 The result is this.

865
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,240
 Through this brokenness comes salvation.

866
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,760
 Christ was born out of Solomon.

867
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,560
 You get that?

868
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,480
 Through that line.

869
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,160
 So not only was David chosen, and not only was he forgiven, he was redeemed.

870
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,560
 Bathsheba was the scarlet letter woman.

871
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,760
 David is the adulterer and the murderer of friends.

872
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,600
 Who's going to be a friend to that?

873
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,640
 And yet Jesus Christ, the savior of the world, came from that line.

874
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,200
 You know what that means?

875
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,880
 It doesn't matter where you've been.

876
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,839
 It doesn't matter who you are.

877
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,839
 It doesn't matter what you've done.

878
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,880
 It doesn't matter where you came from.

879
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:40,600
 In Jesus Christ, you are Jedediah because you come from Jesus.

880
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,040
 You are intimately tied to him.

881
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,600
 The Lord delights in you.

882
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,720
 The Lord loves you.

883
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:55,680
 And if Jesus Christ, his own son suffered, not because he did anything wrong, but because

884
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:04,000
 of God's amazing wisdom and plan, because of his embrace of Jesus and yet the gospel,

885
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,520
 he's going to bring a plan of redemption to fruition through all that brokenness.

886
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:16,560
 That truth is going to bring you delight and love when things are confusing and dark.

887
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,080
 Look, man, I've been through like three major traumas in my life.

888
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:26,440
 I've been through the death of a father that I hardly knew as a result.

889
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,040
 And a lot of suffering came from that.

890
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:36,000
 I've been through the betrayal of the closest friends.

891
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,960
 And it just tore me apart.

892
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,000
 Some of you have been through that, right?

893
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,840
 And I've been through the loss of children.

894
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:58,920
 But some of you are saying, man, I've been through it and I've been in sin for a while.

895
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,280
 But you're here.

896
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,880
 I'm here, right?

897
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,880
 We're here.

898
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,320
 You're sin.

899
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,160
 That life brought you here.

900
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,080
 God delights in his people.

901
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:19,759
 And he will use even your sin, yes, even that brokenness, any weakness to make you a delight

902
00:49:19,759 --> 00:49:22,799
 for his kingdom.

903
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:25,960
 Can that truth, can you anchor into that?

904
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,600
 If you do, it'll give you poise through any circumstance.

905
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,440
 Sorry for the length of this.

906
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,720
 We have to do this today.

907
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,720
 Let's pray together.

908
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,720
 Amen.
