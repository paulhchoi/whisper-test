00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 Please turn with me to 2 Samuel chapter 12 verses 13 to 25.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.280
 You can also follow along on page 7 of your bulletin.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.840
 Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.460
 Nathan replied, the Lord has taken away your sin.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 You are not going to die.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.920
 But because by doing this, you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.160
 The son born to you will die.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.880
 After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife had born to David,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.960
 and he became ill.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.840
 David pleaded with God for the child.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.280
 He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.260
 and he would not eat any food with them.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.519
 On the seventh day, the child died.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.000
 David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, while

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 the child was still living, we spoke to David, but he would not listen to us.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.720
 How can we tell him the child is dead?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.840
 He may do something desperate.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.680
 David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves, and he realized the child

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.039
 was dead.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.440
 Is the child dead?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.440
 He asked.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.300
 Yes, they replied.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.280
 He is dead.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.800
 Then David got up from the ground.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.960
 After he had washed, put on lotions, and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 Lord and worshiped.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.620
 Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.080
 His servants asked him, Why are you acting this way?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.920
 While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.979
 get up and eat.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.000
 He answered, While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.080
 I thought, Who knows?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.800
 The Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live, but now that he is dead, why should

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.200
 I fast?

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.280
 Can I bring him back again?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.680
 I will go to him, but he will not return to me.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.040
 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.680
 She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.040
 The Lord loved him, and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.940
 to name him Jedidiah.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.400
 This is the word of the Lord.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.240
 If you're new or visiting, we've been looking at passages in the Old Testament that demonstrate

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.040
 how God works through brokenness to bring about salvation, and how he works in that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 to build character.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.120
 It's kind of like a mini theme among this overarching theme that we've had about the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 Old Testament.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.000
 But I've got to tell you, passages like today's are really, really difficult.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 You see, David was a man after God's own heart, but in 2 Samuel 11, his life just completely

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.160
 blows up.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.600
 It takes his friend, a good friend, Nathan, to come to him and wake him up out of his

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.240
 self-deception, out of his lies and manipulation.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.720
 He's trapped himself in his sin.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.960
 That's verse 13, but then in verse 14 he says, because of this, because you disregarded God's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.120
 law and because you disregarded essentially God's heart, you broke his heart, that son

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.760
 that was born through this adultery will die.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.280
 This is a really, really difficult passage.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 Why?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.120
 One, theologically, I mean, you've got to wrap your arms around this.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.960
 Why does God do this?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.640
 Why would God do such a thing?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.040
 I mean, Nathan said God had forgiven him.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.040
 Then why this type of suffering?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.320
 That reaches so deep, it's almost like he's tearing his heart apart.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.079
 Secondly, I mean, it's really personal.

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.000
 My own wife and I, we've been through four miscarriages.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.200
 And anyone here, I mean, I know there are a lot of people here, if you're married, if

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.160
 you've been trying to have children, and you understand, every one of those, we lost a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.079
 total of about seven children.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.079
 All of them were hard.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.120
 I mean, I'm talking on the floor, in your bed.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.240
 I can't move difficulty.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.360
 Each one of them painful.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.840
 When Angela was pregnant with my son, David, at that point, we had pretty much given up

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.440
 having children.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.000
 And if you know anything about my history, I mean, we love children.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.140
 I ran a camp for children and for youth for decades.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.120
 And so that was really my only touch point with ministry in an active way.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.080
 And when Angela was pregnant with David, it was really hard for me personally to get really

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.120
 excited about it.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.520
 Because week after week, I was like, this is going to be the week when the shoe drops.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.120
 And I just assumed, my wife would be like, we just passed the first trimester.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.160
 Well, we lost a kid after that one time.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.440
 And so it was just really hard for me to engage there personally.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.600
 And I struggled with that, because every week I was just kind of waiting.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.200
 And you do this for 10 months, it shapes you, you see?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.560
 And David, we named him David because he was the eighth child.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.920
 The actual King David was the eighth child.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.280
 And he was born through a weakness and in weakness.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.320
 And we said, well, that's what we're going to name him when he was born.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.920
 Thirdly, I know that because of this, I mean, we had a ton of people around us during this

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.200
 time.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.820
 But I know that there are women in this room who haven't had a lot of people around them.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.600
 And they are suffering silently.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.760
 I know there are people that's in this room.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.520
 It doesn't even have to be in this context.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.640
 You're just in a lot of suffering.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.080
 You've suffered something.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.760
 It could be something, I'm talking real trauma, right?

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.599
 And you've done it silently.

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.520
 So passages like this are really, really difficult to preach.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 And yet they're in the Bible.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.320
 You can't overlook it.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.599
 How do you develop poise?

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.800
 A poise to confront the most painful moments of your life?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.039
 How do you develop the poise to process even the most painful moments in your life without

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.720
 turning bitter, without despairing?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.880
 I mean, for David and for us, we're going to see three things then today.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.600
 I mean, I can't do justice to the feelings and the suffering that actually takes place

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.600
 in this passage.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.240
 But I can pull out three lessons about suffering, what it is, how you respond to it, and how

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.240
 do you actually recover?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.840
 That's what we're going to look at today.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.239
 First, what is suffering?

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:46.640
 Verse 15, it says that the Lord struck the child that your wife had born to David and

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.640
 he became ill.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.840
 And verse 16, so David's pleading with God and he's fasting and he's praying and he's

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.359
 spent nights on the ground.

00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:59.080
 Verse 17, the elders of that household, they stood beside David to get him up from the

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080
 ground, but he refused.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 He refused to eat.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.239
 He wouldn't eat any food with them.

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:03.239
 Why?

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:05.320
 Why was he on the ground?

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.520
 Part of the reason is because this is a posture of prayer.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.040
 It's a posture of humility.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.960
 A lot of Near Eastern and ancient cultures as well as Eastern cultures, the Lower U-Bow,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.719
 for instance, demonstrates a level of respect.

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:20.280
 David is on the ground.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.480
 So there's a humble posture here.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.880
 There was a prayer posture, but notice the elders, they're trying to get him up.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.680
 They were certainly not trying to get David to stop praying.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.680
 So why?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.440
 Why was he on the ground?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.440
 It's because he was crushed.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.320
 He was just so defeated, crushed, on the ground, on the floor, writhing around, wrestling with

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.320
 God.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.200
 David in a sense is saying, I'm the one who deserves to die here.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.840
 I mean, if my son dies, I'm dead.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.840
 I'm as good as dead.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.960
 Parents, you know, when your child is sick, you've been through this a million times over

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.400
 10, 15 years, 20 years, and some of your children may have suffered, I mean, some big serious

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400
 illnesses.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.080
 But you know, if you could do anything to take that illness away from that child, if

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.320
 you could take it on yourself, you would.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.400
 This is David saying, this child, this infant child is suffering and dying, and he's saying,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.880
 I'm the one who deserves to die.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 I should be there.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.640
 Sometimes that suffering, that pain, that grief is so great, it crushes you.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:28.320
 And when you lose somebody, we'd rather take their place, we say.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.199
 I mean, you're love for that person.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 But we can't stand.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.920
 He can't move.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920
 That's where David is.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.000
 Look, in Western cultures, death is like a sobering experience.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.520
 You stand around, and if you've ever been to a funeral and they're lowering the casket

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.680
 into the ground, there is crying, there may be some weeping.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.360
 If you go to a viewing, there's some weeping, there's some crying.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.800
 But we're taught in Western cultures to internalize that pain.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.960
 We're taught to be strong, to hold your posture, hold your poise.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.880
 In the Eastern culture, in the Near Eastern culture, in the ancient culture, you have

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.760
 to hold people back from jumping and throwing themselves onto a funeral pyre, and that's

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760
 David.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.720
 But then, this is David.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.620
 He's the chosen king.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.080
 This is the man after God's own heart, and it happened to him.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.000
 What does this passage teach you?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 A couple things.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.440
 One, because we're sinners, because of sin in general.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440
 It's just broken the world.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:37.880
 If you don't die young, at some point in your life, you are going to suffer.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:45.280
 You're going to experience on the ground, on the floor, writhing in pain, suffering.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.240
 You're going to at some point in life.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.600
 So let me, I mean, if it happened to David in a sense, and David was the king, he was

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.040
 the chosen king, he was a man after God's own heart, if it can happen to him, and God's

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.920
 got his eyes on David, it can happen to you.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.520
 So let me speak to you like a brother.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.599
 Let me speak to you like a father, one of the older people here in this room.

00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:13.560
 Because of sin in general, because of the curse of sin, because of the brokenness that

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.839
 comes from sin, life is designed to crush you.

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:23.719
 Life is designed to test every foundation that you think you're standing on as solid

00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:25.000
 ground.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.880
 That means you're going to lose people that you love.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.000
 I mean, the finality of it, for good, at the least, that's what's going to happen in your

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 life.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Some of you have lost people.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.480
 I've lost a father at five.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.439
 There are people who've lost their parents.

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:38.439
 You understand.

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:42.880
 I mean, you cannot expect it, even if you're expecting it, it's like a shock.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.080
 It just kind of, it's not even, it punches you in the face and then kind of eases you

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:53.660
 into just a world of like chaos for I don't know how many years.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.800
 So some of us are going to lose people that we love.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.560
 David, I mean, this is the chosen king.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.359
 He's on the ground because death doesn't care who he is.

00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:09.199
 Life doesn't care who he is, right?

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:13.199
 Life is designed to crush who he is.

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:18.400
 But then all of a sudden, he gets up.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.640
 He gets up.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.280
 His servants are amazed and they're confused.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.079
 I mean, when he was alive, you were writhing around on the floor, you were wrestling on

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:31.560
 the ground, but why do you get up?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.400
 God is giving us today an amazing resource to show us on one hand, we're all sinners

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.199
 and we live in a broken world that has just been devastated by sin in general and so because

00:11:41.199 --> 00:11:43.560
 of sin, we're all sufferers.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.680
 We're all sufferers, but on the other hand, it's actually possible.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.800
 There's a resource here in this text that shows us it's possible to get up.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 How?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.800
 Well, it depends on what you do.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.280
 It depends on what you're doing when you're down there on the ground, on the floor.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280
 So how do you respond?

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 That's the second point.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.280
 How do you respond in suffering?

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.000
 There are three things that David grasped when he was on the ground and because he grasped

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 these things, he was able to get up.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.800
 He was actually able to find strength again and recover.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:18.959
 First, he learned, this is really important, he learned that his suffering is not a punishment.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.720
 It's not a reaction for his sins.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.520
 There are times when we suffer as a direct result of our sins.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.200
 Don't get me wrong.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.680
 There are times when there are things that happen because essentially it's not like you

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.320
 asked for it, not that kind of stuff.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.160
 I'm saying that there are things that happen as a direct result.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.760
 For instance, you steal, you get caught, you go to jail.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.140
 That's a direct reaction.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:48.040
 That's not the kind of suffering we're talking about here.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.640
 David here learned that his suffering is not a punishment for his sins.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.719
 Remember, David had an affair with Uriah's wife.

00:12:55.719 --> 00:12:57.920
 That's one of his best friends.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.400
 And he gets her pregnant and in order to come out clean, what does he do?

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:07.240
 He arranges to have that friend of his murdered in battle, killed in battle along with other

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.079
 people.

00:13:09.079 --> 00:13:11.240
 And it looked like he got away with it.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.400
 But God saw all of it.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.280
 And he sends Nathan, Nathan's a prophet, to confront David and David repents.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.079
 Last week, if you were here last week, we looked at David's prayer, his psalm of repentance

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:27.160
 after this particular narrative.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.600
 And verse 13, which we read today, it pretty much sums up that psalm, Psalm 51.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.959
 I've sinned against the Lord.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:38.319
 Meanwhile, Bathsheba, she's pregnant.

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.800
 He takes her in as his wife.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.719
 She has a child, that's David's child.

00:13:44.719 --> 00:13:47.479
 It was this infant that was struck by God.

00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:48.479
 That's what the text says.

00:13:48.479 --> 00:13:55.680
 Now, when you read this cursory, when you read this superficially, you may conclude,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.040
 well, this is God seeking justice for what he's done.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.680
 This is God seeking punishment, justice for David.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.000
 And we say, well, there it is.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 I knew it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.359
 Metro is no different from any other church.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.240
 That fire and brimstone God of the Bible who's always angry, always cruel, it's why I can't

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.520
 believe in a God like this.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.200
 Look, you need to read this passage more carefully.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 And that's why we're here.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.000
 In verse 13, God says through Nathan, the Lord has taken away your sin.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.240
 You are not going to die.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.360
 But now you need to think about that, meditate on that a little bit.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.240
 In the Old Testament, when he says, whenever you hear the phrase, the Lord has taken away

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.620
 your sin, that that meaning is very, very clear.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.440
 That means forensically, legally, you are no longer responsible.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.280
 You are no longer held liable.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.440
 There is no justice nor retribution that will be taken out on you for what you have done.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.680
 The Lord has literally taken that guilt, taken that sin, and has taken it away so it is no

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.920
 longer making you liable.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920
 Right?

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.800
 Nathan says, you are not going to die.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.800
 God has forgiven you.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.200
 You are not going to die because if he dies, that would have been justice.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.800
 It was a capital crime, multiple capital crimes that David had committed in that moment.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.280
 When he had your eye killed, when he got Bathsheba pregnant.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.920
 Nathan says first, you're not going to be punished.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.880
 The Lord is not holding you liable.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.200
 You are not going to die.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200
 But it's also very clear.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200
 This is the second thing.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:27.600
 When Nathan says in verse 13, you are not going to die, then he says in verse 14, but.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600
 He says you're forgiven.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.920
 You're not going to die, but your son will die.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.920
 What does that mean?

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:36.640
 It means there must be another reason for a son's death.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.760
 But at the least, it's not justice.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.760
 It's not punishment.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.560
 Well, if it's not, then why does he make him suffer so much?

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:51.760
 You see, if David believed that his current suffering was a punishment for what he did,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.240
 he would never have been able to get off the ground.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.719
 He would have thrown himself off a cliff.

00:15:55.719 --> 00:15:56.719
 You see that?

00:15:56.719 --> 00:16:01.199
 That guilt would have been overbearing, overwhelming, and he would never have been able to get off

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200
 the ground.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.600
 The reason why, if you look at the Old Testament, the entire book of Job, which is a book in

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.760
 the Old Testament, very famous passage, very famous book, it's written to refute Job's

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760
 friends.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.280
 The whole book was written around the counsel of Job's friends.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:25.680
 Job was a godly man, but God allows for tremendous suffering to happen to Job.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.800
 He allows it.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.420
 And Job's friends, their view is a common view, a very worldly view, even though they

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.560
 come as people of God.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.199
 They basically say their view is this, if you live right, then God's gonna bless you.

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:42.560
 If you live a good life, then God is gonna give you a good life.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.359
 And so if you have a bad life, then you must have done something wrong.

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:50.819
 You must be in sin, and God is demonstrating his retribution or his justice.

00:16:50.819 --> 00:16:53.839
 This is punishment for you.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:00.880
 But what happens if you try to live right, and you're just crushed like Job?

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.600
 Either A, you're gonna say, well, I deserve it.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.120
 There's gonna be a lot of, you're gonna hate yourself, there's gonna be a lot of self-pity.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.880
 Or B, you're gonna say, I don't deserve this.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.880
 I've been trying to live right.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.540
 And you're gonna hate God, or you're gonna hate somebody else, you're gonna blame somebody

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:14.540
 else for it.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.300
 Life is always going to be confusing when you come with that worldview, if you hold

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:23.020
 to that view, because either you're gonna hate yourself, or you're gonna hate God.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.040
 Because you're never gonna be able to avoid the suffering, it's gonna happen.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.680
 You see that?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.200
 Some of us, I mean, we've been there.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.400
 As a pastor, after what, 11 years now here at Metro, I think suffering is probably one

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.680
 of the single greatest reasons for why people abandon God.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.480
 Forget about abandoning church.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.600
 It's one of the greatest reasons why people just kind of sift away from God.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.400
 And most people, we do a little bit of both.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.480
 We hate ourselves a little bit, and we hate God.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.480
 And it's subtle.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.680
 It's like very, very subtle.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.120
 We do, we kind of inch away from Him.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.560
 We're not gonna just kind of drastically walk away, but we inch away from Him relationally

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:07.040
 before we inch away from Him geographically.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.920
 Before we stop going to the church, we distance ourselves in a lot of different ways.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.960
 We're very, very, if you really think about it, that's what we do.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.880
 So we live very powerless lives, because we ultimately never got off the ground.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.080
 We're still metaphorically still on the ground.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.320
 I'm gonna give you a phrase we're gonna say a lot, by faith.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.480
 Only by faith can you believe what Nathan said to David.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.800
 When you're enduring, I mean, some of us right now, we're in it.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.560
 And I know.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560
 It's hard to see.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:44.400
 When you're in that, it's dark, and it's just really, forget about the stress and the pressure.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.640
 It's like you're swimming in a sea of just chaos and darkness.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.720
 And you just kind of let yourself go a little bit, right?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.800
 We're in it.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:00.160
 And only by faith then can you believe what Nathan actually said to David, that you're

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.760
 not being punished right now for what you did.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.800
 Well, then why do you go through this?

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.560
 Well, the second thing that David learned when he was on the ground is that suffering

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.760
 is surgery, a heart surgery.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:13.480
 God isn't trying to hurt David.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.480
 God isn't trying to break David.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.600
 Well, I mean, he took away his child, right?

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.120
 I mean, how can you say that?

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:28.560
 The difference between a serial killer and a doctor or a surgeon is what?

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.800
 They're both holding knives.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.520
 They're both somewhat skilled.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.400
 Is that one is trying to hurt you and kill you, the other is trying to save you.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.200
 God is trying to heal David through this brokenness.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.680
 It's hard for us to kind of grasp that and the why of that.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:52.080
 Nathan says in verse 14, because by doing this, this adultery, this murder, literally

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:57.520
 in Hebrew what he says is, and we read this in the text, because you have shown contempt

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.680
 for the Lord, this son will die.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:06.480
 You see the word contempt, it means to take something lightly, to completely dismiss something.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.200
 It's actually the opposite of giving glory to something.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.320
 The word glory is kabod.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.960
 Contempt is the opposite word in a sense.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.160
 When you show glory, when you demonstrate glory, when you take glory of something, you

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.680
 are sensing the reality of something.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.240
 You're sensing God's reality.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.440
 You're sensing the weight of his beauty, the weight of his brilliance.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440
 It's heavy.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:32.000
 It's weighty in your life, and it's so weighty, it actually shapes you, kind of contorts you.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.780
 It shapes the way you live.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.800
 To treat God then less real, to dismiss that heavy presence, that weightiness of his beauty

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.320
 and his holiness in his life is to show then utter contempt.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.200
 Now, it doesn't mean it's because you didn't know.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.840
 Maybe you knew a lot about God.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.280
 Maybe you know a lot about God.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.639
 Maybe you've learned a lot.

00:20:51.639 --> 00:20:56.360
 Maybe you went to school teaching you about God, but that knowledge hasn't changed you.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.800
 It hasn't shaped you the way you live your current reality.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.159
 Maybe you even feel a little bit.

00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:06.280
 You're moved once in a while, but it's not weighty enough to change the way you live

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.560
 in those patterns that you live in your life.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.560
 You see that?

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.560
 It hasn't shaped you in that way.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.480
 Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.840
 He's a New York Times bestselling author.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840
 He wrote a book called Blink.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.159
 It was, I think, his second big book that he's written.

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:21.879
 I'm just going to paraphrase one part.

00:21:21.879 --> 00:21:26.240
 He refers to this marriage counselor in the book who, after observing a couple, and that's

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.000
 what he does for a living, he just counsels marriages.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.760
 But after having so many counseling experiences and examples in his life, he can just watch

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.060
 a couple in silence.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.520
 Their voices are muted.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.760
 He's got these brainwave things that are on them, and it's kind of scrolling through.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.520
 He used to monitor them, but he says, I can just watch them.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.160
 After three minutes, or it's like two or three minutes or something like that, he can predict

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.360
 whether or not this marriage is going to make it.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.720
 What does he see?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.960
 What is he looking for?

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.920
 He says one of the things that he's looking for is whether or not the husband and the

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.000
 wife are in an argument, and they demonstrate contempt for each other.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.120
 He says that's the death note.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.240
 When I see that, it's over.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.400
 Almost every couple that shows contempt, almost every marriage where there's contempt in the

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.200
 marriage, it ends in failure.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.800
 Nathan here, he says to David, you have shown contempt for God.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.680
 You are relationally bound together by a covenant.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:27.080
 This love-binding promise, this life-binding promise, and you dismissed it.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.200
 You've not seen the weightiness of it.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.600
 You've kind of walked away from it.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.879
 You abandoned his love, you abandoned his honor, you abandoned his love for you, his

00:22:35.879 --> 00:22:40.840
 delight in you, his embrace for you, and so you've distanced yourself, you've divorced

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.159
 yourself from God.

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:48.320
 What kind of man would take another man's wife and then take his life?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.480
 Either you don't believe in God, or God's beauty and his brilliance and his love and

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.159
 his law, they're just concepts that never really entered into your soul and shaped your

00:23:00.159 --> 00:23:01.159
 life.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.120
 You've dismissed God, you've shown contempt for God.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.560
 Instead, you've been captivated by power and your lusts and your wealth and your skills

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.040
 and your wiles and your maneuvering.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.160
 I mean, you could have seen Bathsheba taking that bath from a distance and walked away

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160
 from it.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.320
 But why can't any of us walk away from the things that we want?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.160
 Why can't you walk away from the things that you want?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.320
 Because we're all slaves to our desires.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.040
 That's what the Bible says.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.840
 Abraham, in the Old Testament, first book of the Bible, Abraham in Genesis, he waited

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.240
 for decades for a child, he finally gets that child, it's Isaac.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.760
 Through him, God's gonna redeem the world, but then God says, I want you to surrender

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.360
 that son, I want you to offer that son as a sacrifice.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.679
 It just ripped him apart, it tore him apart.

00:23:48.679 --> 00:23:52.280
 We talked about this passage in our series.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.840
 It just completely tore him apart, but he obeyed.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840
 Why?

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.600
 Because of God's brilliance, his wisdom, that calling of God, it was heavy in his life.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.679
 He didn't have to be goaded into it, he had to be coerced into it or cajoled into it.

00:24:06.679 --> 00:24:08.679
 Because if he was, it's because he was a slave.

00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:10.399
 But he wasn't, he obeyed.

00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:11.399
 Why?

00:24:11.399 --> 00:24:17.600
 Because that heavy brilliance of God was so weighty for him, he didn't become a slave.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.159
 Parents, do you know, parents, do you know that every modern scholar and counselor will

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.720
 tell you that when you make your children the center of your life, then your work will

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.440
 revolve around that child, your church will revolve, your experience of church and your

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.360
 church life will revolve around that child.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.880
 Everything that you do actually revolves around your children.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:46.660
 And it pleases you at first to please them, but you must know, because the weight of your

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:54.960
 own meaning and your own glory and your own joy has taken over the glory of God, you will

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.160
 press that weight then onto your children.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.800
 It's gonna suffocate them under that weight because you were not as gracious as God.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.880
 You were not as wise as God.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.840
 And so you will suffocate them and crush them under the weight of your own expectations

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.000
 and you will ruin your children and because you are a slave, they'll become slaves.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Because you are weak, they will become weak.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.699
 You see that?

00:25:20.699 --> 00:25:24.480
 Because you're a slave, you're gonna make them a slave to all sorts of things.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.080
 It all begins with what?

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.120
 A contempt and a dismissal of God.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.679
 God doesn't just get pushed to the periphery, he just gets completely dismissed.

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:33.679
 You see that?

00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:38.439
 Nathan says to David, you are forgiven, but you need to be healed.

00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:41.120
 You've gone so far.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.719
 You have shown utter contempt for God.

00:25:45.719 --> 00:25:50.959
 You've pushed him completely away and your life is spiraling down, which is why you've

00:25:50.959 --> 00:25:53.100
 committed murder.

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:58.239
 You need to see that with your own eyes and experience that to understand how far you've

00:25:58.239 --> 00:26:00.239
 gone.

00:26:00.239 --> 00:26:08.060
 And so this pain, the suffering.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.679
 Because you are a chosen king, yes on one hand you are forgiven, I love you, I've never

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:15.200
 left you, but look at you.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.040
 Your loneliness and your brokenness and that lack of kingliness, that character that's

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:25.240
 missing in your life, the cowardice and the deceit and the manipulation and the self-righteousness

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.200
 that's all wrapped in that.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.919
 You need to be healed because otherwise your life will continue to roll back, more people

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:37.280
 will die, more people will suffer around you and even though you may not die, if this kingdom

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.760
 and this world is going to be redeemed through you, then you need to experience, you need

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.879
 to come back.

00:26:46.879 --> 00:26:53.560
 You're getting almost a visual inner perspective of the pain and the picture of how dead you

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.920
 are in your sin because death is separation and it's painful.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.399
 Death is final and it's painful.

00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:03.500
 It's over.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.000
 So David, he falls to the ground and he's pleading and he's praying, you've ever been

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 there?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.360
 I mean there are people in this room and they're saying, man I've tried that already.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.520
 Pastor, I've tried that.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.920
 I've pleaded and I've prayed.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920
 I've pleaded with God.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920
 I've wrestled with God.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920
 Nothing happened.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.000
 God will not help me.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.760
 I can't trust God and that's even if he exists, it's like he doesn't exist.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.040
 Friends, that's what God is trying to heal David from.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:34.320
 David, God stopped being a reality in his life and he had to uproot the sin that is

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.520
 so deep and has rooted itself in him.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.560
 That's what he was trying to heal him from.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.879
 The reason why we say, well I can't trust a God that allows this kind of stuff, it's

00:27:47.879 --> 00:27:51.040
 the same reason why David abandoned God in the first place.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.000
 Distrust, contempt, the moment you say that you're saying I'm showing contempt.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.040
 I'm dismissing this.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.320
 We need to be healed of that.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.120
 God must have told David at some point, you see it in this passage.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.399
 I need to take your son.

00:28:07.399 --> 00:28:09.439
 He's not going to suffer anymore.

00:28:09.439 --> 00:28:11.800
 He's going to be with me.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:17.560
 I'm taking him into eternity with me but it's going to feel like death for you.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.199
 It's going to feel like your heart is being ripped apart so I can give you a new heart.

00:28:22.199 --> 00:28:23.199
 You're going to heal.

00:28:23.199 --> 00:28:25.919
 You're going to be free again.

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:26.919
 Did it work?

00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:29.280
 Yes, it worked.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.239
 Verse 18, the child dies.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.280
 Verse 19, David realizes that and he asks, is he dead?

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.800
 They say yes, it happened.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800
 What happens?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.560
 Verse 20, he gets up.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.400
 Scholars say up until this point David was using everyone.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.960
 Bathsheba was just an object.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.080
 Uriah was just a barrier.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.200
 Joab was a tool.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.400
 David wasn't a servant anymore.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400
 He was a consumer.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.800
 A lot of us here, we're just consuming and anytime we don't get what we want, whether

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.560
 it's in the church or at work or at home, complain, complain, complain.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.760
 You're falling into that right now.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.360
 A lot of us are like that towards God.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.100
 We're like that towards the church but David, for David here his life changes.

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.480
 When he gets up, his servants are confused.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.639
 Verse 21, when a child was alive you fasted and you wept but now he's dead and you get

00:29:21.639 --> 00:29:22.879
 up and you're ready to eat.

00:29:22.879 --> 00:29:27.200
 Verse 22, David says, well, when a child was alive I thought maybe the Lord will let him

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200
 live.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.480
 Maybe I suffered enough and I'm good now.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.640
 We do that, don't we?

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640
 I'm good.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.640
 I get it now.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.640
 I got it guys.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.320
 A lot of you, you've been through a lot and you're like, I'm good now.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320
 I get it now.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.520
 I've learned a lot now.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:48.000
 We still want to tell and dictate to God on our terms when something should start, when

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.960
 something should end because we think we're still wiser.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.880
 Parents, you see your children, right?

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.880
 What's that little thing?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880
 That's an electrical socket.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880
 Don't put your fingers there.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.880
 What do they do?

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.040
 They say, no, no, no, I need to do this.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.040
 That's what they say.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.560
 They don't say, I want to do it.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.240
 Well, why dad?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.840
 They say, no, no, no, it's wise for me to do this.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.160
 They're like, I must do this.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.540
 Right?

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.480
 And it's like suffering for them when you try to tell them when you block it, when you

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.080
 put those little things in there to prevent them from putting anything in the socket.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.840
 It's like the world has ended.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.920
 That's us.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.600
 That's us.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.480
 Robert Alter, well, David says, verse 23, now that he's dead, can I bring him back again?

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.719
 Robert Alter, he's a famous biblical scholar, liberal scholar.

00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:36.919
 I think I've said this multiple times, but nobody like Robert Alter when it comes to

00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:38.840
 the understanding of the ancient Hebrew.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.320
 So even all conservatives, we all read him.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:46.159
 He says that this is the first time in a long time where David is just helpless.

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:48.959
 He's just broken and helpless.

00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:50.760
 Before he was addicted to power.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.280
 Now he's just completely vulnerable.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.399
 He's on the ground.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.440
 And this sets the pace for the rest of his life.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.920
 He's been torn down, but he's been freed.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.720
 His life has changed.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.680
 Before he was addicted to power, he was addicted to just his desires.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.680
 Now he's just humble.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.360
 I'm going to say it like this.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.240
 One day, everyone is going to experience something so painful, it's going to throw you to the

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.760
 ground.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:26.600
 And there you're going to see the link between your suffering and God's wisdom and your character.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:33.320
 And if all those three things come together, there will be joy in your life.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.960
 That joy will sustain.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:44.040
 Suffering is the crucible by which God builds wisdom and character and kingliness unto greatness.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.800
 God says, it pains me to do this.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.280
 You're going to understand.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.280
 This is God.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:49.840
 It pains me to do this.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.040
 But this is surgery.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.360
 Because you have something that is life threatening.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.800
 And most of the time, we are not going to know.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.160
 We're going to have no idea what God is trying to free us from.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.920
 It's not until months go by, maybe years go by, maybe decades, when you look back and

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.800
 say, okay, now I see.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.040
 He was tearing away the thing that I wanted most apart from him.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.080
 People weren't trying to tell me maybe.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.919
 People were trying to, you know, and I just dismissed it.

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:22.360
 That's made me anxious.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.800
 This thing has made me anxious.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.199
 It's made me depressed.

00:32:25.199 --> 00:32:33.320
 It's made me lonely and proud and sinful and dismissive, murderous, hate, right?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:38.960
 Adulterous, lustful, greedy.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:47.480
 He's breaking the things that were breaking me.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.240
 Because I was the way I was.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240
 I was breaking things.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240
 I was breaking relationships.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.560
 But he was breaking the things that were breaking me.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.680
 So you read this call to worship at the start of worship, Psalm 39, an amazing prayer because

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.680
 at the end, basically the psalmist says, you know, get away from me so I can have some

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.720
 peace in my life.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.840
 Just get away from me so I can have some peace before I die.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.840
 And then the psalm ends.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.040
 There's no peace.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.879
 There's no praise at the end.

00:33:10.879 --> 00:33:12.919
 That's why this psalm is so good.

00:33:12.919 --> 00:33:14.600
 It's why God put it in the Bible.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600
 You know why?

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.879
 Because it tells us that God knows us.

00:33:17.879 --> 00:33:23.919
 He hears us when we are just raw and unfiltered and just desperate and on the ground and writing

00:33:23.919 --> 00:33:29.040
 all sorts of lies are coming into our hearts and we're kind of tempted to believe it and

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.159
 we're just kind of talking to ourselves in our hearts and we're just desperate and raw

00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:35.159
 and in pain and on the ground.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:41.680
 I mean, of course, it's not all good stuff, but to know that God hears us, to know that

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.000
 he understands, I mean, why else would it be in the Bible?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 And look at David.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.680
 Even though David is in this terrible place spiritually, he doesn't fake it anymore.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.320
 He's just on the ground.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:58.480
 His servants are like, oh my gosh, he's going to do something desperate.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.200
 He's a mess, functionally, physically, but directionally.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.600
 He gets it.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.279
 He now knows and never stops from there.

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:13.319
 It's that really proud person that says, well, because I can't see a reason for my suffering,

00:34:13.319 --> 00:34:15.080
 there must be no reason.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.080
 It must not be true.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.400
 There must not be a good reason.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400
 Terrible.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.000
 That's terrible logic because if you have a God that is powerful enough to stop the suffering

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.679
 and you may not see any redeeming part of that situation right now, then you need to

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:33.560
 trust that God, if he is infinitely powerful, he's infinitely wise enough to have reasons

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.320
 for why he doesn't answer your prayers because he is a God of love.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.600
 Do you trust that?

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.080
 Do you trust that?

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.199
 What does David do on the floor?

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.880
 He knew that it wasn't punishment.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.440
 He knew that it was surgery in his heart to become a wiser person, a fuller person, a

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.520
 deeper person, even a more joyful person.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.080
 I mean, you see it in Psalm 51.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.040
 You see that latter half of Psalm 51, seven or eight verses.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.000
 He says, I'm going to be a worshiper again.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.160
 I'm going to be joyful again.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.160
 He knows.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:04.120
 But only if one, you're on the floor and you're crying out to God, two, it's just really real.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.120
 It's really personal.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:10.200
 And three, you're still clinging to God no matter the outcome because the primary outcome

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.120
 is you are back in the Lord again.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.960
 You are intimate with God again.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.120
 So you pray and you pray that you have a wisdom that God has, but you may not know the answer

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.600
 to what God is doing or why he's doing it.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.480
 You're just trusting.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.560
 You're just submissive.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.520
 This part's really important, verses 17 to 19.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.360
 His friends, they're trying to help him, but that help, it's not even effective until verse

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:40.080
 20 when that recovery, that surgery is complete, when that recovery finally begins.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.880
 Religious people, we tend to be really stoic in suffering.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.840
 You don't want to show that you have need.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.480
 You don't want to show that you are weak.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.799
 Irreligious people, they don't have problems showing that they're weak, but they mourn

00:35:51.799 --> 00:35:53.920
 without hope, right?

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.520
 They don't believe that there's any help.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.759
 What's the point of trying to put up pretenses?

00:35:59.759 --> 00:36:01.120
 There is no hope.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:07.120
 The gospel teaches us that God knows, he understands, he wants to hear you.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.280
 He wants to see that rawness.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:18.520
 So you can mourn, and you gotta be real, but you can mourn with hopefulness because you

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:23.240
 can trust that God is gonna work through this.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.280
 I don't know the outcome.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.800
 I don't even know why.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:33.400
 I may not know why, but I do know that God works through it.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.960
 For David, his son dies, but he's renewed.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960
 He recovers.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960
 He gets up.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
 How did he recover?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960
 That's our last point.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:47.920
 I know this is a little bit long, but I have to, I told myself, I was wrestling myself,

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.360
 do I just cut it short?

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.160
 But we gotta do this.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.000
 Some of us, we're still on the floor, how do you get up?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.920
 When he gets up, he tells a little secret.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:04.080
 I mean, how are you able to trust God in a way that propels you to joy?

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:08.880
 David must have heard two assurances, and we need to hear those two assurances too.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.040
 What are they?

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:16.160
 Two phrases, verse 22, he will not come to me, but I will go to him.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:23.240
 And then in verse 25, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.720
 David named him Solomon, God sends Nathan and says, name him Jedidiah.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.200
 We need to do the same in both cases.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200
 What do I mean by that?

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.859
 First, he will not come to me, I will go to him.

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:36.759
 Why is he able to say that?

00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:40.799
 Nathan assures David, you are pardoned.

00:37:40.799 --> 00:37:41.799
 That was the start.

00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:46.640
 He trusted God's love, and so Psalm 51, that beautiful psalm of repentance, he begins with

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.259
 appealing to the unfailing love of God.

00:37:50.259 --> 00:37:51.419
 He trusted in God's love.

00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:52.419
 He trusted his wisdom.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:57.920
 He's saying one day, even this pain is going to get swallowed up by a greater joy that's

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.920
 going to come.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:05.960
 I mean, right now, it sounds horrible, it feels awful, but unlike any other religion,

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:10.440
 the God of the Bible doesn't ask us to do anything that he hasn't done himself.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:16.200
 The God of the Bible says to Abraham, he says to David, redemption is not going to go forward

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.120
 unless your son dies.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.480
 Your son must die.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.480
 Offer him up.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:25.720
 Abraham offers his son, but then his son is spared.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.720
 God says, and Abraham trusted him.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.200
 It was brutal.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.360
 Three days of just brutal journey up a mountain to sacrifice his son, but he's spared.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.480
 God says to David, your son must die, and he does.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.000
 So he's separated from his father.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.040
 Look at the agony of David.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.880
 But David never even got to know his son.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.040
 And God essentially says, he's with me.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.040
 Right?

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.400
 Verse 22, what he's really saying is David's going to go to see him.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.120
 He must have been assured that he will see him again.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.760
 But when Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, there was not

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.200
 just a partial, temporary separation from the father.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.160
 David temporarily separated from his son.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.920
 Jesus Christ was completely separated from the father.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.480
 He was completely separated.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.520
 And remember, Jesus is in the father.

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:19.920
 The father is in Jesus.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.600
 There was complete union.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.600
 So when he died, this ultimate agony, this forensic separation that took place, my God,

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.600
 my God, why have you forsaken me?

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.640
 This is the ultimate agony.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.620
 This is the ultimate desperation of the soul.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.759
 So much that Jesus on the cross says, what?

00:39:36.759 --> 00:39:37.759
 I'm thirsting.

00:39:37.759 --> 00:39:40.440
 You think he was thirsting just for water?

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:46.680
 He was craving the one thing that was sustaining his life and his soul up until this point.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.080
 Before he goes to the cross, I guess, what does he say?

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.440
 My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.720
 In other words, Jesus Christ was on the ground.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.839
 He was wrestling on the ground, stayed on the ground.

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:08.000
 I mean, death, that's what he was doing.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.279
 He was wrestling.

00:40:10.279 --> 00:40:13.919
 He was beaten up.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:20.800
 And he's wrestling with God and he's praying, take this wrath away from me.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.640
 But then he says, but not my will, yours be done.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.640
 He obeyed.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.280
 He was submissive.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.380
 He trusted.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:33.320
 Even as God legally had separated from him, he trusted God.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.040
 To the point of death, there was no contempt.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.180
 The weight of the heavy brilliance of God was still there.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.560
 Even as God had forensically abandoned his son and rejected him on the cross.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.759
 Because when Jesus fell, he fell to his death and he fell to the utter depths and he was

00:40:48.759 --> 00:40:54.799
 so far on the ground that they buried him and he stayed there.

00:40:54.799 --> 00:40:56.480
 Death is finality.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.480
 Death is separation.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.040
 Jesus says it is finished.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.360
 The debt is paid.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.360
 It's over.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.680
 When he got up, he rose to glory.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:12.680
 Jesus Christ, and this is the son, there was, he experienced endless separation.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.120
 The agony of separation on the cross.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120
 But think about this.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120
 Look at David.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120
 He's suffering.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.520
 How much more would God, David is the father looking at his son being separated from him.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:29.000
 How much more would God the father suffer watching his son?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.480
 You would say we would take his place and yet he turned his face from him.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.080
 God himself suffering complete separation and agony too.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.799
 Others would poetically say that the Trinity was torn apart.

00:41:42.799 --> 00:41:50.200
 It wasn't really, it was forensically, but it was torn apart.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.759
 Does God hear us in our pain?

00:41:52.759 --> 00:41:56.040
 Does God understand our suffering?

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:00.080
 Only the God of the Bible understands.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:06.040
 He not only understands what it's like to suffer, but he suffered.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.000
 No one ever lost a child like God lost his own son.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.560
 And to the degree that you see, to the degree that you believe that God sent his own son

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:20.680
 to die for you, that God himself placed his own life to suffer for you.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.720
 That's the assurance that God is in your suffering and that through your suffering, through your

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.920
 brokenness, when Jesus suffered and died, people said nothing good can come from this.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.240
 Maybe that's what you're saying in your life, but that's what God does.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.000
 He works through suffering.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.400
 He works through brokenness.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.900
 He works through your sin.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.200
 He works through the ugliest to bring about a greater beauty, a greater joy, a greater

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.200
 victory.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.480
 And if you believe that he did that through Jesus and through somebody like David, he

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.000
 can do that for you.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 What's the assurance?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.280
 Jesus received all the punishment.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.640
 That's why David was forgiven.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:59.120
 That's why we can be forgiven here.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:03.560
 That's why we can be reconciled to God and intimate with God because Jesus Christ received

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.680
 all the punishment that we deserve so that we can have the reconciliation and intimacy

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.440
 and love and embrace that Jesus deserved.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.640
 So we receive the blessing and the love and the pardon for sin.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:19.419
 Otherwise God is not just.

00:43:19.419 --> 00:43:21.680
 Sin would win if he would just let us go.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.480
 Even if he lets one of your smallest sins go, sin wins.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.040
 You see that?

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:33.080
 So either God is love and God is just so much that he's willing to sacrifice his own son.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.799
 Just the son that he loved for you or God is not loving and he's not just and Jesus

00:43:37.799 --> 00:43:41.960
 Christ is willing and Jesus Christ basically died for no reason.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960
 You see that?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.200
 And yet he was willing to suffer.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.680
 Look at Jesus.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680
 He was willing to suffer.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.960
 He was willing to die.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.040
 He was glad for the joy set before him.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.520
 That was a prayer for the city today.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.040
 For the joy set before him.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.319
 He was glad to die for you.

00:43:56.319 --> 00:43:57.319
 Do you believe this?

00:43:57.319 --> 00:43:59.400
 I mean more than it just moving you.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.440
 Do you get it?

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.760
 Because if you do then God becomes a source of your joy.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.720
 You will unhook from something else as a source of your joy.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.280
 God becomes a source of your joy and when suffering comes it drives you into a deeper

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:17.240
 joy the way roots extend deeper into the depths during drought or in fire or in the desert

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:25.520
 to find an everlasting well of a loving and just God who saves into eternity.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.920
 It makes us more like Jesus.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.520
 Shapes our character.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.800
 The reality is that look we're all sinners.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.040
 We're all sufferers.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.240
 But can you suffer with poise?

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.200
 Jesus didn't suffer to take away all of our suffering or any suffering in our lives but

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.600
 so that when we suffer it's not a punishment.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.840
 It's not to ruin you but it will grow you, shape you, change you into a greater intimacy

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.940
 with God that only Jesus enjoyed himself.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.560
 That's going to make you more like Jesus.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560
 That's going to shape you.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:06.880
 That weightiness of his beauty and brilliance will shape you to make you more like his child.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.760
 And so if you look at Jesus, the ultimate suffering on the cross, why did he stay there?

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.560
 Because he says if you die then it's like I'm dead.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:26.400
 Actually he said so that you wouldn't die, I'll die.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.840
 Because what's going to get you off the ground?

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.040
 Well there's one more thing.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.080
 We said there were three things that he learned.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:36.200
 One more thing that gets him up and allows him to recover.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:43.880
 Verse 24 he says, then David comforted his wife Bathsheba and they slept together and

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:47.440
 Bathsheba gave birth to a son, Danian and Solomon.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:52.020
 The Lord loved him and because the Lord loved him he sent word through Nathan the prophet

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:56.280
 to name him Jedediah which means, Jedediah means the beloved of God.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.840
 He delighted in Jedediah.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840
 This is amazing.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.840
 David had several wives.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.280
 You have to understand this.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.480
 He had several children.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:10.240
 But God gives David and Bathsheba this kind of prostitute-ish person, disgraced woman.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.960
 He gives them both another child, another son.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.840
 You need to know that Solomon, the word Solomon comes, is derived from the word shalom.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.840
 Right?

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.600
 Kind of sounds the same, right?

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.120
 It's a holistic peace.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.120
 David is saying in the name of Solomon, because it's my way of saying to God, I'm at peace.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.120
 I'm at peace.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.120
 But God says no.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.359
 I want you to name him Jedediah.

00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:34.440
 The Lord loves.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.920
 The Lord delights in this child.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:40.240
 Of all the marriages, this is the marriage he chose.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.440
 Of all the children, this is the one, the one that suffered, the one that was ugly and

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.560
 disgraced to save the world.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.000
 That means, you know what that means?

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 David screwed up.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.440
 Yes, he was an adulterer.

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440
 He was a murderer.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:56.480
 The result is this.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.240
 Through this brokenness comes salvation.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.760
 Christ was born out of Solomon.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.560
 You get that?

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.480
 Through that line.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.160
 So not only was David chosen, and not only was he forgiven, he was redeemed.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.560
 Bathsheba was the scarlet letter woman.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.760
 David is the adulterer and the murderer of friends.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.600
 Who's going to be a friend to that?

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.640
 And yet Jesus Christ, the savior of the world, came from that line.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.200
 You know what that means?

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.880
 It doesn't matter where you've been.

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.839
 It doesn't matter who you are.

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:31.839
 It doesn't matter what you've done.

00:47:31.839 --> 00:47:33.880
 It doesn't matter where you came from.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:40.600
 In Jesus Christ, you are Jedediah because you come from Jesus.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.040
 You are intimately tied to him.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.600
 The Lord delights in you.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.720
 The Lord loves you.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:55.680
 And if Jesus Christ, his own son suffered, not because he did anything wrong, but because

00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:04.000
 of God's amazing wisdom and plan, because of his embrace of Jesus and yet the gospel,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.520
 he's going to bring a plan of redemption to fruition through all that brokenness.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:16.560
 That truth is going to bring you delight and love when things are confusing and dark.

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.080
 Look, man, I've been through like three major traumas in my life.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:26.440
 I've been through the death of a father that I hardly knew as a result.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.040
 And a lot of suffering came from that.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:36.000
 I've been through the betrayal of the closest friends.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.960
 And it just tore me apart.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.000
 Some of you have been through that, right?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.840
 And I've been through the loss of children.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:58.920
 But some of you are saying, man, I've been through it and I've been in sin for a while.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.280
 But you're here.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.880
 I'm here, right?

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.880
 We're here.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.320
 You're sin.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.160
 That life brought you here.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.080
 God delights in his people.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:19.759
 And he will use even your sin, yes, even that brokenness, any weakness to make you a delight

00:49:19.759 --> 00:49:22.799
 for his kingdom.

00:49:22.799 --> 00:49:25.960
 Can that truth, can you anchor into that?

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.600
 If you do, it'll give you poise through any circumstance.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.440
 Sorry for the length of this.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.720
 We have to do this today.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720
 Let's pray together.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.720
 Amen.
