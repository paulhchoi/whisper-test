00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 Please turn with me to 2 Samuel, chapter 12, verses 13 to 25.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.240
 You can also follow along on page 7 of your bulletin.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.960
 Then David said to Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 Nathan replied, the Lord has taken away your sin.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.920
 You are not going to die.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.040
 But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the Lord show utter contempt, the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.080
 Son born to you will die.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.600
 After Nathan had gone home, the Lord struck the child that your eyes wife had born

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.000
 to David, and he became ill.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.800
 David pleaded with God for the child.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.280
 He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.879
 The elders of his house holds to decide him to get him up from the ground, but he refused

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.280
 and he would not eat any food with them.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.400
 Until the 7th day the child died.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.000
 David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead for they thought, while

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 the child was still living, we spoke to David, but he would not listen to us.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.680
 How can we tell him the child is dead?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 He may do something desperate.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.280
 David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.080
 child was dead.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.440
 Is the child dead?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.440
 He asked.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240
 Yes, they replied.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 He is dead.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.679
 Then David got up from the ground.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.839
 After he had washed, put on locians and changed his clothes, he went into the house of

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:37.160
 the Lord and worshiped.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.600
 Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food and he ate.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.000
 His servants asked him, why are you acting this way?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.960
 While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 get up and eat.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.000
 He answered, while the child was still alive, I fasted and wept.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.320
 I thought, who knows, the Lord may be gracious to me and let the child live.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.199
 But now that he is dead, why should I fast?

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.280
 Can I bring him back again?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.640
 I will go to him, but he will not return to me.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.040
 Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.680
 She gave birth to a son and the named him Solomon.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.040
 The Lord loved him and because the Lord loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920
 to name him Jada Dayo.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 This is the word of the Lord.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.280
 If you are new or visiting, we have been looking at passages in the Old Testament that demonstrate

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.920
 how God works through brokenness to bring about salvation.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.120
 And how he works in that to build character, it is kind of like a mini-themed among

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.240
 this overarching thing that we have had about the Old Testament.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.080
 But I got to tell you passages like todays is really, really, really difficult.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.800
 You see, David, David was a man after God's own heart, but in 2 Samuel 11, his life

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.040
 just completely blows up.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.520
 And it takes his friend, a good friend, Nathan, to come to him and wake him up out of

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.760
 this self-deception, out of his lies and manipulation and just he's trapped himself in his

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 sin.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 That's verse 13.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.959
 And then in verse 14 he says, because of this, because you disregard God's law and because

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.640
 you disregard it essentially God's heart, you broke his heart.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.760
 That son that was born through this adultery will die.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 This is a really, really difficult passage.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.399
 Why?

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:39.040
 One, theologically, I mean, you got to wrap your arms around his, why does God do this?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.640
 Why would God do such a thing?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 I mean, Nathan said, God have forgiven him, then why this type of suffering, that reaches

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 so deep.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.480
 It feels like it's tearing his heart apart.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.119
 Secondly, I mean, it's really personal.

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:56.040
 My own wife and I, we've been through four miscarriages.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.239
 And anyone here, I mean, I know there are a lot of people here, if you're married, if

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.079
 you've been trying to have children and you understand, every one of those, we lost

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.160
 a total of about seven children.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160
 All of them were hard.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.120
 I mean, I'm talking on the floor in your bed.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.240
 I can't move difficulty.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.320
 Each one of them painful.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.920
 When Angela was pregnant with my son David, at that point, we had pretty much given up

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.560
 having children.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.000
 And if anything while my sister, I mean, we love children.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.240
 I ran a camp for children and for youth for decades.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.120
 And so that was really my only touch point with ministry in an active way.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.160
 And when Angela was pregnant with David, it was really hard for me personally to get really

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160
 excited about it.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.480
 So week after week, I was like, this is going to be the week when the shoe drops.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.440
 And I just assumed my wife would be like, we just passed the first trimester while we

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.160
 lost a kid after that one time.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.440
 And so it was just really hard for me to engage there personally.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.600
 And I struggled with that because every week I was just kind of waiting.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.960
 And you do this for 10 months.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.160
 It shapes you, you see.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.480
 And in a David, we named him David because he was the eighth child.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.800
 The actual King David was the eighth child.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.440
 And he was born through a weakness.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.440
 And in weakness.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.440
 And we said, well, that's what we're going to name him when we were.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.280
 It was born.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.960
 Thirdly, I know that because of this, we had a ton of people around us during this

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.120
 time.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.840
 And but I know that there are women in this room who haven't had a lot of people around

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840
 them.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.560
 And they are suffering silently.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.720
 I know there are people in this room.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.520
 It doesn't even have to be in this context.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.560
 You're just in a lot of suffering.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.000
 You've suffered something.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.640
 It could be something I'm talking real trauma.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640
 Right.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.520
 And you've done it silently.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.479
 So passages like this are really, really difficult to preach.

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.479
 And yet they're in the Bible.

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.240
 You can't overlook it.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.719
 How do you develop poise, a poise to confront the most painful moments of your life?

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:07.960
 How do you develop the poise to process even the most painful moments in your life without

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.400
 turning bitter, without despairing?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.719
 I mean, for David and for us, we're going to see three things then today.

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:23.640
 I mean, I can't do justice to the feelings and the suffering that actually takes place in

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640
 this passage.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.760
 But I can pull out three lessons about suffering.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.000
 What it is.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.440
 How you respond to it and how do you actually recover?

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.880
 That's what we're going to look at today.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.159
 First, what is suffering?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.320
 First, 15.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.720
 It says that the Lord struck the child at your eyes of why you've had born to David and

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
 he became ill.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.040
 And verse 16 is a David's pleading with God and he's fasting and he's praying and he's

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.400
 spent nights on the ground.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.080
 Verse 17, the elders of that household, they stood beside David to get him up from the

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080
 ground.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.040
 But he refused to eat, he would need any food with them.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.040
 Why?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.320
 Well, why was he on the ground?

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.200
 One of the reasons is because this is a posture of prayer.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.560
 It's a posture of humility.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.440
 A lot of near-eastern and ancient cultures, as well as eastern cultures, the lower you

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.800
 bowel, for instance, show them demonstrates a level of respect.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.320
 They say, David is on the ground.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.440
 So here's a humble posture here.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.840
 There was a prayer posture.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.920
 But notice the elders, they're trying to get him up.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.680
 They were certainly not trying to get David to stop praying.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.320
 So why?

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320
 Why was he on the ground?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.400
 It's because he was crushed.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.880
 He was just so defeated, crushed on the ground, on the floor, arriving around, wrestling

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880
 with God.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.000
 David in a sense is saying, I'm the one who deserves to die here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.719
 I mean, if my son dies, I'm dead.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.960
 I'm as good as dead parents, you know.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.960
 When you're child-a-sick, you've been through this a million times over 10, 15 years, 20

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.960
 years.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.120
 And some of your children may have suffered, I mean, some big, serious illnesses.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.200
 You know, if you could do anything to take that illness away from that child, if you could

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.280
 take it on yourself, you would.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.280
 This is David saying, this child is infant child is suffering and dying.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.840
 And he's saying, on the one who deserves to die, I should be there.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.200
 Sometimes, that's suffering, that pain, that grief is so great.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.800
 It crushes you.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.480
 And when you lose somebody, we'd rather take their place.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480
 We say.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.080
 I mean, you're a love for that person.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.720
 So we can't stand.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.720
 He can't move.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.160
 That's where David is.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.960
 Look, in Western cultures, death is like a sobering experience.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.040
 You stand around.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.880
 And as you've ever been to a funeral and they're lowering the casket into the ground, there

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880
 is crying.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880
 There may be some weeping.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.320
 If you go to a viewing, there's some weeping, there's some crying.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.760
 But we're taught in Western cultures to internalize that pain.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.960
 We're taught to be strong, to hold your posture, hold your poise.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.960
 In the eastern culture, in the near eastern culture, in the ancient culture, you have to

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.560
 hold people back from jumping and throwing themselves onto a funeral pire.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.200
 And that's David.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.200
 But then this is David.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.600
 He's the chosen king.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.800
 This is the man after God's own heart.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.000
 And it happened to him.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.200
 Where's his passage teach you?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200
 A couple things.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.840
 One, because we're sinners.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.720
 Because of sin in general, it's just broken the world.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:37.840
 If you don't die young, at some point in your life, you are going to suffer.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:45.240
 You're going to experience on the ground, on the floor, rising in pain, suffering.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.240
 You're going to at some point in life.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.440
 So let me, I mean, if it happened to David in a sense, and David was the king.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.440
 He was the chosen king.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.560
 He was a man after God's own heart.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.920
 If it can happen to him, and God's God is eyes on David, it can happen to you.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.560
 So let me speak to you, like a father, like a father, one of the older people here in this

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.199
 room, because of sin in general.

00:10:11.199 --> 00:10:16.839
 Because of the curse of sin, because the brokenness that comes from sin, life is designed

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:23.000
 to crush you, life is defined, designed to test every foundation that you think you're standing

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 on as solid ground.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.840
 That means you're going to lose people that you love.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.000
 I mean, the finality of it, for good, at the least that's what's going to happen in your

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 life.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Some of you lost people.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.200
 I lost a father at five.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.440
 There are people who've lost their parents.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.160
 You understand?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.160
 That's true.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160
 I mean, you cannot expect it.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.800
 Even if you're expecting, it's like a shock.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.520
 It's just kind of, it punches you in the face, and then kind of eases you into just a world

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.640
 of chaos for, I don't know, how many years.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.280
 So some of us are going to lose people that we love.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.560
 David, I mean, this is the chosen king.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.360
 He's on the ground, because Beth doesn't care who he is.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.360
 Life doesn't care who he is, right?

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.240
 Life doesn't, life is designed to crush who he is.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.960
 But then, all of a sudden, he gets up.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.680
 He gets up.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.359
 His servants are amazed and they're confused.

00:11:25.359 --> 00:11:28.239
 I mean, when he was alive, you were riding around on the floor.

00:11:28.239 --> 00:11:29.880
 You were wrestling on the ground.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.599
 But why do you get up?

00:11:31.599 --> 00:11:34.800
 God is giving us today an amazing resource to show us.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.959
 On one hand, we're all sinners, and we live in a broken world that has just been devastated

00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.280
 by sin in general.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.520
 And so because of sin, we're all sufferers.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.319
 We're all sufferers, but on the other hand, it's actually possible.

00:11:46.319 --> 00:11:50.920
 There's a resource here in this text that shows us it's possible to get up.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.240
 Now, what depends on what you do.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.240
 It depends on what you're doing when you're down there on the ground, on the floor.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.079
 So, how do you respond?

00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:00.079
 That's the second point.

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:01.079
 How do you respond in suffering?

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:05.920
 There are three things that David grasped when he was on the ground.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.959
 And because he grasped these things, he was able to get up.

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:12.040
 He was actually able to find strength again and recover.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.040
 First, he learned.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.439
 This is really important.

00:12:14.439 --> 00:12:18.959
 He learned that his suffering is not a punishment.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.760
 It's not a reaction for his sins.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.800
 There are times when we suffer as a direct result of our sins.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.200
 Don't get me wrong.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.720
 There are times when there are things that happen because essentially, it's not like you

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720
 asked for.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.720
 Not that kind of stuff.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.160
 I'm saying that there are things that happen as a direct result, right?

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.720
 For instance, you steal, you get caught, you go to jail.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.160
 That's a direct reaction.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.960
 That's not the kind of suffering we're talking about here.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.200
 David here learned that his suffering is not a punishment for a sins.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.600
 David had an affair with Uriah's wife.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.880
 That's one of his best friends.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880
 And he gets her pregnant.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.200
 In order to come out clean, what does he do?

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.840
 He arranges to have that friend of his murdered in battle, killed in battle, along

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.000
 with other people.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.840
 And it looked like he got away with it.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.400
 But God saw all of it.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:19.160
 He sends Nathan, Nathan's a prophet to confront David and David repent.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.199
 Last week, if you were here last week, we looked at David's prayer, his Psalm, of repentance

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:27.199
 after this particular narrative.

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:32.600
 And verse 13, which we read today, it pretty much sums up that Psalm, Psalm 51.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.600
 I've sinned against the Lord.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.319
 Meanwhile, Bathsheba, she's pregnant.

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:40.040
 He takes her in as his wife.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.680
 She has a child that's David's child.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.400
 It was this infant that was struck by God.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.240
 That's what the text says.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:56.120
 Now, when you read this cursory, when you read this superficially, you may conclude,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.959
 well, this is God seeking justice for what he's done.

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:04.640
 This is God seeking punishment, justice for David.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.000
 And we say, well, there it is.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.760
 I knew it, Metro is no different from any other church that fire and brinstone, God

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.720
 of the Bible, who's always angry, always cruel.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.400
 It's why I can't believe in a God like this.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.200
 Look, you need to read this passage more carefully.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200
 And that's why we're here.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.960
 And verse 13, God says through Nathan, the Lord is taken away or sin.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.200
 You are not going to die.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.920
 But now you need to think about that.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.720
 Meditate on that a little bit.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.400
 And the Old Testament, when he says, when you hear the phrase, the Lord is taken away or

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.520
 sin, that meaning is very, very clear.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.360
 That means forensically, legally, you are no longer responsible.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.199
 You are no longer held liable.

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:50.400
 There is no justice nor retribution that'll be taken out on you for what you have done.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.240
 The Lord is literally taking that guilt, taking that sin and it's taken it away.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.959
 So it is no longer making you liable.

00:14:57.959 --> 00:14:59.640
 Nathan says, you are not going to die.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640
 God has forgiven you.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.160
 You are not going to die because if you die, that would have been justice.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.800
 It was a capital crime, multiple capital crimes that David committed in that moment.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.199
 When he entered your eye, killed, when he got back to you, but pregnant.

00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:16.920
 Nathan says, first, you're not going to be punished.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.880
 The Lord is not holding you liable.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.199
 You are not going to die.

00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:21.199
 But it's also very clear.

00:15:21.199 --> 00:15:22.199
 This is the second thing.

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:25.040
 When Nathan says in verse 13, you are not going to die.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.600
 Then he says in verse 14, but he says, you're forgiven.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.839
 You're not going to die.

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:31.120
 But your son will die.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120
 What does that mean?

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.680
 There must be another reason for a son's death.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.800
 But at least it's not justice.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.160
 It's not punishment.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.560
 Well, if it's not, then why does he make him suffer so much?

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:51.760
 You see, if David believed that his current suffering was a punishment for what he did,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.480
 he would never have been able to get off the ground.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.800
 He would have thrown himself off a cliff.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800
 You see that?

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.000
 That guilt would have been overbearing, overwhelming.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.800
 And he would never have been able to get off the ground.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.479
 The reason why, if you look at the Old Testament, the entire book of Joe, which is a book

00:16:07.479 --> 00:16:12.400
 in the Old Testament, very famous passage, very famous book, it's written to refute

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.520
 Job's friends.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.199
 The whole book was written around the Council of Job's friends.

00:16:18.199 --> 00:16:25.640
 Job was a godly man, but God allows for tremendous suffering to happen to Job.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.800
 He allows it.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.479
 And Job's friends, their view is a common view of very world review, even though they

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.520
 come as people of God.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.400
 They basically say their view is this.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.160
 If you live right, then God's going to bless you.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.520
 If you live a good life, then God is going to give you a good life.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.360
 And so if you have a bad life, then you must have done something wrong.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.800
 You must be in sin, and God is demonstrating his retribution or his justice.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.800
 This is punishment for you.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:17:00.880
 But what happens if you try to live right, and you're just crushed like Job.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.720
 You're going to say, why deserve it?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.440
 There's going to be a lot of, you're going to hate yourself, just going to be a lot of

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.440
 self-pity or be.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.040
 You're going to say, I don't deserve this.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.960
 I've been trying to live right, and you're going to hate God or you're going to hate

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.960
 somebody else.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.440
 You're going to blame somebody else for it.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.000
 Life is always going to be confusing when you come with that world view.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.560
 If you hold to that view, because either you're going to hate yourself or you're going

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.880
 to hate God.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.720
 Because you're never going to be able to avoid the suffering.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720
 It's going to happen.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.680
 You see that?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.200
 Some of us, I mean, we've been there.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.480
 As a pastor, after what 11 years now here at Metro, I think suffering is probably one of

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.880
 the single greatest reasons for why people abandon God.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.440
 Forget about abandoning church.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.640
 It's one of the greatest reasons why people just kind of sift away from God.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.440
 And most people, we do a little bit of both.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.520
 We hate ourselves a little bit, and we hate God.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.520
 And it's subtle.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.680
 It's like very, very subtle.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.040
 We do, we kind of inch away from them.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.399
 And we're not going to just kind of drastically walk away, but we inch away from him

00:18:02.399 --> 00:18:07.000
 relationally before we inch away from him geographically.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.920
 Before we stop going to the church, we distance ourselves in a lot of different ways.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.360
 We're very, very, if you really think about that, what we do, and so we live very powerless

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.800
 lies because we ultimately never got off the ground.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.080
 We're still metaphorically still on the ground.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.080
 I'm going to give you a phrase.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.280
 We're going to say a lot by faith.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.480
 Only by faith, can you believe what Nathan said to David?

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.800
 When you're enduring, I mean, some of this right now, we're in it.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.120
 And I know it's hard to, when you're in that, it's dark.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.399
 And it's just really, forget about the stress and the pressure.

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:48.600
 It's like you're swimming in a sea of just chaos and darkness.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.760
 And you just kind of let yourself go a little bit, right?

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.760
 We're in it.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.160
 And only by faith, then, can you believe what Nathan actually said to David that you're

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.680
 not being punished right now for what you did?

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.920
 Well, then why do you go through this?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.879
 Well, the second thing that David learned when he was on the ground is a suffering, is

00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:11.720
 surgery, a heart surgery.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.400
 God isn't trying to hurt David.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.400
 God isn't trying to break David.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.720
 Well, I mean, it took away his child, right?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.000
 I mean, how can you say that the difference between a serial killer?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.560
 Then the difference between a serial killer and a doctor who's surgeon is what?

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.800
 They're both holding knives.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.520
 They're both somewhat skilled.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.600
 Is that one is trying to hurt you and kill you.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.360
 The other is trying to save you.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.640
 God is trying to heal David through this, brokenness.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.600
 It's hard for us to kind of grasp that and the why of that.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:52.640
 Nathan says in verse 14, because by doing this, this adultery, this murder, literally Hebrew,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:58.560
 what he says is, and we read this in the text, because you are shown contempt for the Lord,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560
 this Son will die.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.960
 You see, the word contempt.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:06.120
 It means to take something lightly, to complete this miss something.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.240
 It's actually the opposite of giving glory to something.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.960
 The word glorious, come both, content is the opposite word in a sense.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.080
 When you show glory, when you demonstrate glory, when you take glory to something,

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.639
 you are sensing the reality of something, you're sensing God's reality, you're sensing

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:26.399
 the weight of his beauty, the weight of his brain.

00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:28.760
 It's heavy, it's weighty in your life.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:33.800
 And it's so weighty, it actually shapes you, kind of contorts you, it shapes the way you live.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.840
 To treat God then less real, to dismiss that heavy presence, that weightiness of his beauty

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.320
 and his holiness in his life is to show that utter contempt.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.159
 Now, doesn't mean it's because you didn't know.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.600
 Maybe you knew a lot about God, maybe you know a lot about God, maybe you've learned a lot.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.680
 Maybe you've went to school teaching you a lot about God, but that knowledge hasn't changed

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680
 to you.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.840
 It hasn't shaped you the way you live your current reality.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.040
 Maybe you even feel a little bit, you're moved once in a while, but it's not weighty enough

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.600
 to change the way you live in those patterns that you live in your life.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.600
 You see that?

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.920
 It hasn't shaped you in that way.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.600
 Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.800
 He's in New York Times, bestselling author.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.280
 He wrote a book called Blink.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.080
 He was, I think, a second big book that he's written.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.879
 I'm just going to paraphrase one part.

00:21:21.879 --> 00:21:26.280
 He refers to this marriage counselor in the book who after observing a couple of him, that's

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.280
 what he does for living.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.399
 He just counsels marriages, but after having so many counseling experiences and examples in

00:21:32.399 --> 00:21:35.800
 his life, he can just watch a couple in silence.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.480
 Their voices are muted.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.639
 He's got these brainwave things that are on them and it's kind of scrolling through it

00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:42.080
 and he can mount he's to monitor them.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.600
 He says, I can just watch them and after three minutes or it's like two or three minutes

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.280
 or something like that, he can predict whether or not this marriage is going to make it.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.720
 What does he see?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.720
 What is he looking for?

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.240
 He says, one of the things that he's looking for is whether or not the husband and the wife

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.000
 are in an argument and the demonstrate content for each other.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.080
 He says, that's the death note.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.120
 When I see that, it's over.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:09.320
 Almost every couple that shows content and almost every marriage where there's content in

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.199
 the marriage, it ends in failure.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:16.800
 Nathan here, he says to David, you have shown content for God.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.640
 You are relationally bound together by a covenant.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:26.200
 This love binding promise, this life binding promise and you dismissed it.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.160
 You've not seen the weightiness of it.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.640
 You've kind of walked away for you.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:36.280
 Abandon his love, you abandoned his honor, you abandoned his love for you, is delighting

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.080
 you, his embrace for you and so you've distanced yourself.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.120
 You've divorced yourself from God.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.320
 What kind of man would take another man's wife and then take his life?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.480
 Either you don't believe in God or God's beauty and it brilliance and it's love and

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480
 it's law.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.840
 They're just concepts that never really entered into your soul and shaped your life.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.600
 So you dismissed God, you shall contend for God instead.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.879
 You've been captivated by power and your lusts and your wealth and your skills and your

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880
 manoeuvring.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:18.520
 You could have seen that shoe by taking that bath from a distance and walked away from

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520
 it.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.320
 Why can't any of us walk away from the things that we want?

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.280
 Why can't you walk away from the things that you want?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.960
 Because we're all sleigh towards desires.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.000
 That's the Bible says.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.840
 Abraham in the Old Testament, first book of the Bible, Abraham in Genesis, he waited

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.280
 for decades for a child, he finally gets that child, it's Isaac.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.800
 Through him, God's going to redeem the world.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.320
 But then God says, I want you to surrender that son.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.280
 I want you to offer that son as a sacrifice.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.919
 It may just rip them apart.

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:48.919
 It tore him apart.

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:52.280
 We've talked about this passage in our series.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.800
 It just completely tore him apart.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.600
 But he obeyed why?

00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:01.480
 Because God's brilliance, his wisdom, that calling of God, it was heavy in his life.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.040
 He didn't have to be coated into it.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.680
 He had to be coerced into it or could jolt into it because if he was, it's because he

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.080
 was a slave.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.760
 But he wasn't he obeyed why?

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.399
 Because that heavy brilliance of God was so witty for him.

00:24:15.399 --> 00:24:18.320
 He didn't become a slave.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.560
 Parents, do you know?

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.360
 Parents, do you know that every modern scholar in council will tell you that when you

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.120
 make your children the center of your life, then your work will revolve around that child,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.320
 your church will revolve around your experience of church.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.240
 And your church life will revolve around that child.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.919
 Everything that you do as you revolve around your children.

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:42.200
 And it pleases you at first to please them.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:49.280
 But you must know because the weight of your own meaning and your own glory and your

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.720
 own joy has taken over the glory of God.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.159
 You will press that weight then onto your children.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:04.880
 It's going to suffocate them under that weight because you were not as gracious as God.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.880
 You were not as wise as God.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.880
 And so you will suffocate them and crush them under the weight of your own expectations

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.920
 and you will ruin your children because you are a slave, they'll become slaves.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.960
 Because you are a weak, they will become weak.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.720
 You see that?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.480
 Because you're a slave, you're going to make them a slave to all sorts of things.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.120
 It all begins with what?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.120
 A contempt and a dismissal of God.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.159
 God doesn't just get pushed to the periphery.

00:25:31.159 --> 00:25:32.600
 He just gets completely dismissed.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600
 You see that?

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.439
 Nacan says to David, you are forgiven but you need to be healed.

00:25:38.439 --> 00:25:41.120
 You've gone so far.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.679
 You have shown utter contempt for God.

00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:51.000
 You've pushed him completely away and you're like the spiraling down which is why you've

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.120
 committed murder.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.280
 You need to see that with your own eyes and experience that to understand how far you've

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.000
 gone.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And so this pain, the suffering.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Because you are a chosen king.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.959
 Yes, on one hand, you are forgiven.

00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:12.959
 I love you.

00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:15.120
 I've never left you but look at you.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.120
 You're loneliness and you're brokenness and that lack of kingliness, that character, that's

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.280
 missing in your life, the cowardice and the deceit and the manipulation and the self-righteousness

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.239
 that don't wrap in that.

00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:32.000
 You need to be healed because otherwise your life will continue to roll back more people

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.399
 will die more people will suffer around you and even though you may not die if this kingdom

00:26:37.399 --> 00:26:43.679
 and this world is going to be redeemed through you, then you need to experience.

00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:46.919
 You need to come back.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:53.240
 You're getting almost a visual inner perspective of the pain and the picture of how dead

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.680
 you are in your sin.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.960
 Because death is separation and it's painful.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.640
 Death is final and it's painful.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.520
 It's over.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.720
 So David, he falls to the ground and he's pleading and he's praying.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720
 You've ever been there.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.640
 There are people in this room and they're saying, man, I've tried that already.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.640
 Pastor, I've tried that.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.960
 I've pleaded and I've prayed.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960
 I've pleaded with God.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.720
 I've wrestled with God.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720
 That's even if he exists.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.880
 It's like he doesn't exist.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:27.160
 Friends, that's what God is trying to heal David from.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:35.320
 David, God stopped being a reality in his life and he had to uproot the sin that is so deep

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.520
 and has rooted itself in him.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.800
 That's what he was trying to heal him from.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.840
 This is why we say, well, I can't trust a God that allows this kind of stuff.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.040
 It's the same reason why David abandoned God in the first place.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.040
 This trust, contempt.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.040
 The moment you say that you say, I'm showing contempt.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.080
 I'm dismissing this.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.320
 We need to be healed of that.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.320
 God must have told David at some point.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.159
 You see it in this passage.

00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:07.320
 I need to take your son.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.440
 He's not going to suffer anymore.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.960
 He's going to be with me.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.720
 I'm taking him into eternity with me.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.560
 But it's going to feel like death for you.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.200
 It's going to feel like your heart is being ripped apart so I can give you a new heart.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.840
 You're going to heal.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.920
 You're going to be free again.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.560
 Did it work?

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.240
 Yes, it worked.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.200
 Verse 18, the child dies.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.680
 Verse 19, David realizes that and he asks, is he dead?

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.760
 He says, yes, it happened.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760
 What happens?

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.320
 Verse 20, he gets up.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.240
 The scholar say up until this point, David was using everyone.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.960
 That he was just an object.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.040
 Your eye was just a barrier.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.080
 Joe Ab was a tool.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.439
 David wasn't a servant anymore.

00:28:55.439 --> 00:28:56.439
 He was consumer.

00:28:56.439 --> 00:28:58.720
 A lot of us here were just consuming.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.800
 At any time, we don't get what we want.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.560
 Whether it's in the church or at work or at home, complain, complain, complain.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.960
 You're falling into that right now.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.360
 A lot of us are like that towards God.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360
 Or like that towards the church.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.080
 But David, for David here, his life changes.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.479
 When he gets up, his servants are confused.

00:29:17.479 --> 00:29:20.320
 Verse 21, when the child was alive, you fastened your weapon.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.840
 Now, he's dead and you get up and you're ready to eat.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.879
 Verse 22, David says, well, when the child was alive, I thought maybe he needed to lure

00:29:26.879 --> 00:29:29.000
 a little bit of them live.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.479
 Maybe I suffered enough and I'm good now.

00:29:31.479 --> 00:29:32.479
 We do that.

00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:33.479
 Don't we?

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:34.479
 I'm good.

00:29:34.479 --> 00:29:35.479
 I get it now.

00:29:35.479 --> 00:29:36.479
 I got it guys.

00:29:36.479 --> 00:29:38.320
 A lot of you, you've been through a lot and you're like, I'm good now.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320
 I get it now.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320
 I've learned a lot now.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320
 Right?

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:47.399
 Because we still want to tell and dictate to God on our terms when something should

00:29:47.399 --> 00:29:49.280
 star, when something should end.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.919
 Because we think we're still wiser.

00:29:50.919 --> 00:29:53.840
 Parents, you see your children, right?

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840
 What's that little thing?

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.840
 That's electrical socket.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.159
 Don't put your fingers there.

00:29:57.159 --> 00:29:58.159
 What do they do?

00:29:58.159 --> 00:29:59.639
 No, no, no, I need to do this.

00:29:59.639 --> 00:30:00.639
 That's what they say.

00:30:00.639 --> 00:30:02.639
 They don't say, I want to do it.

00:30:02.639 --> 00:30:04.240
 Well, you know, like, why dad?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.800
 They say, no, no, no, it's wise for me to do this.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.080
 They're like, I must do this.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.480
 And it's like suffering for them when you try to tell them when you block it, when you

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.639
 put those little things in there to prevent them from putting anything in the socket.

00:30:16.639 --> 00:30:18.639
 It's like the world is ended.

00:30:18.639 --> 00:30:21.879
 You know, that's us.

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:24.639
 That's us.

00:30:24.639 --> 00:30:25.639
 Robert Alter.

00:30:25.639 --> 00:30:29.520
 Well, David says, first 23, now that he's dead, can I bring him back again?

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.120
 Robert Alter is a famous biblical scholar.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.360
 Liberal scholar, I think I said this multiple times, but nobody like Robert Alter

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.840
 when it comes to understanding of the ancient Hebrew.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.320
 So even all conservatives, we all read him.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.000
 He says that this is the first time in a long time where David is just helpless.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.720
 He's just broken and helpless.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.240
 Before he was addicted to power, now he's just completely vulnerable.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.399
 He's on the ground.

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:56.439
 And this sets the pace for the rest of his life.

00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:59.000
 He's been torn down, but he's been freed.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.679
 His life has changed.

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:06.720
 Before he was addicted to power, he was addicted to his desires.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.200
 Now he's just humble.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.440
 I'm going to say it like this.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.040
 One day, everyone is going to experience something so painful.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:18.800
 I'm going to throw you to the ground.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:25.640
 And there you're going to see the link between your suffering and God's wisdom and your

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640
 character.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:33.400
 And if all those three things come together, there will be joy in your life.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.840
 That joy will sustain.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:41.520
 The suffering is the crucible by which God builds wisdom and character and kinkliness

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.120
 unto greatness.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.800
 God says, it pains me to do this.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.240
 You're going to understand, this is God.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:55.439
 It pains me to do this, but this is surgery because you have something that is life-threatening.

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:57.840
 And most of the time, we are not going to know.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.159
 We are going to have no idea what God is trying to free us from.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.720
 It's not until months go by.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.720
 Maybe years go by.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.800
 Maybe decades when you look back and say, okay, now I see.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:14.000
 He was tearing away the thing that I wanted most apart from him.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.080
 People were going to try to tell me, maybe.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.840
 People were trying to, you know, and I just dismissed it.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.280
 That's made me anxious.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.760
 This thing has made me anxious.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.160
 It's made me depressed.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.920
 It's made me lonely and proud and sinful and dismissive.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.480
 Murderous, hate, right?

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:38.920
 A adulterous, lustful, greedy.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:47.280
 He's breaking the things that were breaking me.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.280
 Because I was the way I was.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.480
 I was breaking things, I was breaking relationships.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.520
 But he was breaking the things that were breaking me.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:58.480
 So you read this called a worship at the start of worship, Psalm 39, an amazing prayer

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.160
 because at the end, basically the Psalmist says, you know, get away from me.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.640
 So I can have some peace in my life.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.640
 Just get away from me.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.800
 So I can have some peace before I die.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.200
 And then the Psalm ends.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200
 There's no peace.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.800
 There's no praise at the end.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.800
 That's why the Psalm is so good.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.600
 It's why God put it in the Bible.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.600
 You know why?

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.920
 Because it tells us that God knows us.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.720
 He hears us when we are just raw and unfiltered and just desperate and on the ground and

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.520
 riding all sorts of lies are coming into our hearts and we're kind of tempted to believe

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.000
 it and we're just kind of talking to ourselves in our hearts and we're just desperate and

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.160
 raw and in pain and on the ground.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.280
 I mean, of course, it's not all good stuff.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.760
 But to know that God hears this, to know that He understands.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.040
 I mean, why else would it be in the Bible?

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.480
 And look at David, even though David isn't this terrible place spiritually, he doesn't

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.280
 fake it anymore.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.480
 He says on the ground, his servants are like, oh my gosh, he's going to do something desperate.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.600
 He's a mess functionally physically, but directionally he gets it.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.360
 He now knows and never stops from there.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.360
 It's that really proud person that says, well, because I can't see a reason for my suffering,

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.080
 there must be no reason.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.080
 It must not be true.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.600
 There must not be a good reason.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.600
 Terrible.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.960
 Because if you have a God that is powerful enough to stop the suffering and you may not

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:29.000
 see any redeeming part of that situation right now, then you need to trust that God if

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.759
 He is infinitely powerful, he's infinitely wise enough to have reasons for why He doesn't

00:34:34.759 --> 00:34:37.360
 answer your prayers because He has a God of love.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:39.360
 Do you trust that?

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.120
 Do you trust that?

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120
 What does David do on the floor?

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.839
 He knew that it wasn't punishment.

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:48.400
 He knew that it was surgery and it's hard to become a wise person, a fuller person, a

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.560
 deeper person, even a more joyful person.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.080
 I mean, you see it in Psalm 51.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.000
 You see that latter half of Psalm 51, seven or eight verses.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.040
 He says, I'm going to be a worshiper again.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.160
 I'm going to be joyful again.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.880
 He knows, but only if one, you're on the floor and you're crying out to God, too.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.920
 It's just really, really, really personal and three.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.840
 You're still clinging to God, no matter the outcome.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.000
 Because the primary outcome is you are back in the Lord again.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.960
 You are intimate with God again.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.080
 You pray and you pray that you have a wisdom that God has, but you may not know the answer

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.560
 to what God is doing or why He's doing it.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.480
 You're just trusting.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.880
 You're just submissive.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.680
 This part is really important.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.480
 Verse 17 to 19.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:35.040
 His friends are trying to help him, but that help, it's not even effective until verse 20,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.920
 when that recovery, that surgery is complete.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.920
 When that recovery finally begins.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.840
 Really just people, we tend to be really stoic in suffering.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.760
 You don't want to show that you have need.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.960
 You don't want to show that you are weak.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.160
 It really just people.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.880
 You don't have problems showing that they're weak, but they mourn without hope.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.480
 They don't believe that there's any help.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.120
 What's the point of trying to put up pretense is there is no hope?

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.920
 The gospel teaches us that God knows, he understands.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.120
 He wants to hear you.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.280
 He wants to see that raunus.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:18.000
 So you can mourn and you've got to be real, but you can mourn with hopefulness.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.320
 Because you can trust that God is going to work through this.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.360
 I don't know the outcome.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.840
 I don't even know why.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.600
 I may not know why.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.400
 But I do know that God works through it.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.960
 For David it's undies, but he's renewed.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.200
 He recovers.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200
 How did he recover?

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 That's all the last point.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.400
 I know this is a little bit long, but I told myself, wrestling myself to just cut it short,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.200
 but we got to do this.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.480
 Some of us were still on the floor.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.480
 How did he get up?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.520
 David, when he gets up, he tells a little secret.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.920
 I mean, how are you able to trust God in a way that propels you to joy?

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.720
 David must have hurt two assortances.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.879
 We need to hear those two assurances too.

00:37:08.879 --> 00:37:10.080
 What are they?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080
 Two phrases.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.200
 Verse 22, he will not come to me, but I will go to him.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:25.040
 And then in verse 25, he sent work through the name of David, David named him Solomon.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.720
 God sends Nathan says, name of Jetta Daya.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.520
 We need to do the same.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.879
 In both cases, what do I mean by that?

00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:34.879
 First, he will not come to me, I will go to him.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:40.880
 Why is he able to say that, Nathan sure is David, you are parted.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880
 That was the start.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.040
 He trusted God's love.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:48.200
 And so Psalm 51, that beautiful Psalm of repentance, he began with appealing to the unfailing

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.320
 love of God.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.480
 He trusted and God's love.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.120
 He trusted his wisdom, he's saying, one day, even this pain is going to get swallowed

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.120
 up by a greater joy that's going to come.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.840
 I mean, right now it sounds horrible, it feels awful, but unlike any other religion,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:11.080
 the God of the Bible doesn't ask us to do anything that he hasn't done himself.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.280
 God of the Bible says to Abraham, he says, David, redemption is not going to go forward

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.120
 unless you're a son dies.

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.400
 Your son must die, offer him up.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.720
 Abraham offers his son, but then his son is spared.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.680
 God says, and Abraham trusted him, it was brutal, three days of just brutal journey up

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.200
 a mountain to sacrifice his son, but he spared God says to David, you're son must die,

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.480
 and he does.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.080
 So he's separated from his father.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.040
 He looked at the agony of David.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.799
 But David never even got to know his son.

00:38:48.799 --> 00:38:52.440
 And God essentially says, he's with me.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.399
 Right, verse 22, what he's really saying is David's going to go to see him.

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:58.120
 He must have been assured that he will see him again.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:03.799
 So when Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, there was not

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:07.000
 just a partial temporary separation from the Father.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.359
 David temporarily separated from his son.

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:14.200
 Jesus Christ was completely separated from the Father.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.440
 He was completely separated.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.960
 And remember, Jesus is in the Father, the Father is in Jesus.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.600
 There was complete union.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.000
 So when he died, this ultimate agony, this forensic separation that took place.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.640
 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.720
 This is the ultimate agony.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.720
 This is the ultimate desperation of the soul.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.680
 So much that Jesus on the cross says, what?

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.080
 I'm thirsty.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.920
 You think he was thirsty just for water?

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.360
 He was craving the one thing that was sustaining his life and his soul up until that's

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.680
 point.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.440
 Before he goes to the cross, I guess, so many.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.440
 What does he say?

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.520
 My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.960
 In other words, Jesus Christ was on the ground.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.400
 He was wrestling on the ground.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.840
 Stayed on the ground.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:08.000
 Death, death, that's what he was doing.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.280
 He was wrestling.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.840
 He was beaten up.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:20.840
 And he's wrestling with God and he's praying, take this wrath away from me.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.720
 But then he says, but not my will, yours be done.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:24.720
 He'll be paid.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.320
 He was submissive.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320
 He trusted.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:33.360
 Even as God legally had separated from Him, he trusted God.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.080
 To the point of death, there was no content.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:39.240
 The weight of the heavy brilliance of God was still there.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.600
 Even as God had friends, it was abandoned his son and rejected him on the cross.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.560
 So when Jesus fell, he fell to his death and he fell to the utter depths.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.840
 And he was so far on the ground that they buried Him and he stayed there.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.280
 That is finality, death, that's the separation.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.000
 Jesus says, it is finished.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.280
 The death is paid.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.320
 It's over.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.800
 When he got up, he rose to glory.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.200
 Jesus Christ, I'm this the son.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.640
 There was, he experienced endless separation.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.080
 The agony of separation on the cross.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.080
 But think about this.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.080
 Look at David.

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080
 He's suffering.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.080
 How much more would God?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.480
 David is the father looking at his son being separated from him.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.520
 How much more would God the father?

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:33.840
 Suffer, watching his son, you would say we would take his place and yet he turned his face

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.480
 from him.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.800
 God himself suffering complete separation and agony too.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.840
 Scholars with poetically say that the Trinity was torn apart, it didn't really, it wasn't

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.160
 really, it was forensically.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.240
 But it was torn apart.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.839
 God he was in our pain, does God understand our suffering?

00:41:55.839 --> 00:42:00.120
 Only the God of the Bible understands.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:06.000
 He not only understands what it's like to suffer but he suffered.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.020
 No one ever lost a child like God lost his own son and to the degree that you see, to the

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:16.919
 degree that you believe that God sent his own son to die for you, that God himself

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.600
 places his own life to suffer for you.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.560
 That's the assurance that God is in your suffering and that through your suffering, through

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.800
 your brokenness when Jesus suffered and die people said nothing good can come from this.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.040
 Maybe yes, what you're saying in your life.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.240
 But that's what God does.

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.000
 He works through suffering.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.400
 He works through brokenness.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.880
 He works through your sin.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.280
 He works through the uglyest to bring about a greater beauty, a greater joy, a greater

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280
 victory.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.640
 People believe that he did that through Jesus and through somebody like David, he can

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.000
 do that for you.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 What's the assurance?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.240
 Jesus received all the punishment.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.560
 That's why David was forgiven.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.080
 That's why we can be forgiven here.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.680
 That's why we can be reconciled to God and intimate with God because Jesus Christ received

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.760
 all the punishment that we deserve.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.440
 So we can have the reconciliation and intimacy and love and embrace that Jesus deserved.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:13.600
 We receive the blessing and the love and the pardon for sin.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:21.680
 Otherwise, God is not God is not just sin would win if you would just let us go.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.560
 Even if he lets one of your smallest sins go, sin wins.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.560
 You see that?

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:32.280
 So why God is love and God is just so much that He's willing to sacrifice His own

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.560
 son, He's the son that He loved for you or God is not loving and He's not just.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.960
 Jesus Christ is willing and Jesus Christ is basically died for no reason.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.960
 You see that?

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.120
 And yet He was willing to suffer.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120
 Look at Jesus.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.960
 He was willing to die.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.000
 He was glad for the joy set before Him.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.560
 That was a prayer for the city today.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.040
 For the joy set before Him.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.320
 He was glad to die for you.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.320
 Do believe this.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:01.480
 I mean, more than it just moving, you do get it.

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:04.759
 Because if you do, then God becomes the source of your joy.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.640
 You will unhook from something else as a source of your joy.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.880
 God becomes a source of your joy.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.400
 And when suffering comes, it drives you into a deeper joy the way, the way roots extend

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.560
 deeper into the depth during drought.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:21.320
 We're in fire or in the desert to find an everlasting well of a loving and just God who

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.520
 saves into eternity.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.800
 It makes us more like Jesus.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.640
 Sheaths our character.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.839
 She reality is that look, we're all sinners.

00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:37.040
 We're all sufferers.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.080
 But can you suffer with voice?

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.240
 Jesus didn't suffer to take away all of our suffering or any suffering in our life.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.560
 But so that when we suffer, it's not a punishment.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.160
 It's not to ruin you.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:56.040
 But it will grow you, shape you, change you into a greater intimacy with God that only

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.920
 Jesus enjoyed himself.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.520
 It's going to make you more like Jesus.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.440
 It's going to shape you, that weightiness of his beauty and brilliance will shape you to

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.840
 make you more like his child.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:12.720
 And so if you look at Jesus, the ultimate suffering on the cross, why did he stay there?

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.160
 Because he says, if you die, then it's like I'm dead.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.960
 Actually, he said, so that you wouldn't die.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.240
 I'll die.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:30.560
 That's what's going to get you off the ground.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.560
 There's one more thing.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.000
 There were three things that he learned.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.120
 One more thing that gets him up and allows him to recover.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.120
 Verse 24.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.879
 He says, then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and they slept together.

00:45:43.879 --> 00:45:47.399
 And Bathsheba gave birth to a son, they named him Solomon.

00:45:47.399 --> 00:45:52.040
 The Lord loved him and because the Lord loved him, he said, we're through Nathan the prophet

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.279
 to name him Jedi, which means Jedi means the beloved of God.

00:45:56.279 --> 00:45:57.840
 He delighted and Jedi.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:58.840
 This is amazing.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.400
 David, it's several wives.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.240
 You have to understand this.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.400
 He had several children.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:10.200
 But God gives David and Bathsheba this kind of prostitute-ish person, disgraced woman.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.920
 He gives them both another child, another son.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.360
 You need to know the Solomon, the word Solomon is derived from the word Sha'ul-Om.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.360
 Right?

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.360
 It sounds the same.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.120
 It's a holistic piece, David is saying, on the name of Solomon, because it's my way of

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.600
 saying to God, I'm at peace.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.000
 I'm at peace.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.320
 But God says, no, I want you to name him Jedi.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:38.200
 The Lord loves the Lord the lights in this child of all the marriages.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.160
 This is the marriage you chose.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.800
 Of all the children, this is the one that suffered the one that was ugly and disgraced

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.520
 to save the world.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.880
 That means, you know what that means?

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.880
 David screwed up.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.360
 Yes, he was an adulterer.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360
 He was a murder.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.440
 But the result is this.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.759
 Through this brokeness, consolation Christ was born out of Solomon.

00:47:00.759 --> 00:47:02.560
 You get that?

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.480
 Through that line.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:11.240
 So not only was David chosen and not only was he forgiven, he was redeemed.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.200
 Bathsheba was the scarlet letter woman.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.480
 David is the adulterer and the murder of friends, who's going to be a friend to that?

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.919
 And your Jesus Christ, the savior of the world, came from that line.

00:47:24.919 --> 00:47:26.240
 You know what that means?

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.240
 It doesn't matter where you've been.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.240
 It doesn't matter who you are.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.120
 It doesn't matter what you've done.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.839
 It doesn't matter where you came from.

00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:40.600
 And Jesus Christ, you are Jedi, because you come from Jesus.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.000
 You are intimately tied to him.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.760
 The Lord the lights in you, the Lord loves you.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:55.720
 And if Jesus Christ, his own son suffered, not because he did anything wrong, but because

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:04.000
 of God's amazing wisdom and plan, because of his embrace of Jesus and yet the gospel,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.520
 he's going to bring a plan of redemption to fruition through all that brokeness.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:16.520
 That truth is going to bring you to light and love when things are confusing and dark.

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.120
 Look, man, I've been through like three major traumas in my life.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:26.440
 I've been through the death of a father that I hardly knew as a result.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.040
 And a lot of suffering came from that.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:36.040
 I've been through the betrayal of the closest friends.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.920
 And it just tore me apart.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.320
 Some of you have been through that, right?

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:46.320
 And I've been through the loss of children.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:56.600
 But some of you are saying, man, I've been through it.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.600
 And I've been in sin for a while.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.600
 But you're here.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.880
 I'm here, right?

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.880
 We're here.

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:08.160
 You were sin that life brought you here.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.680
 You're not the lights in his people.

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:19.759
 And he will use even your sin, yes, even that brokeness, any weakness to make you a delight

00:49:19.759 --> 00:49:22.799
 for his kingdom.

00:49:22.799 --> 00:49:30.640
 Can that truth, can you anchor into that if you do it, it'll give you poise through any circumstance.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.680
 So far for the length of this, we have to do this today.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.680
 Let's pray together.
